            <p>
               <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> (The Swedish Literature Bank) is a freely
                    available digital collection of Swedish literary works, ranging from medieval to
                    contemporary literature. It is the result of a cooperation between literary and
                    linguistic scholars, research libraries, and editorial societies and academies.
                    The collection consists not only of digital facsimiles, but of ocr'ed,
                    proof-checked and TEI-encoded transcriptions as well, including EPUB and HTML
                    versions of texts, and in addition scholarly presentations and didactic
                    introductions to works and authors in the collection. It is also being used as a
                    publishing platform for ongoing Swedish scholarly editing projects.
                        <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> currently comprises more than 2.000 works,
                    mounting up to more than 100 million of machine-readable words.
                        <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>'s main weak spot is transparency; it does not
                    openly provide satisfactory ways to ensure the editors accountability for the
                    edited texts and images. As a whole, however, <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> is
                    an impressive endeavour and paves the way for fruitful cooperation and massive
                    data exchange with e.g. computational linguistics and bibliographic
                    databases.</p>

               <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> is an organization that aims to make the most
                    important works of Swedish literature freely accessible to the general public
                    through its website, litteraturbanken.se. It is gradually being recognized as
                    the most prominent collection of digitized literary works in Sweden, and is the
                    result of a co-operation between the <emph>Swedish Academy</emph>; the
                        <emph>Swedish National Library</emph>; the <emph>Royal Swedish Academy of

                    also reflected in the <emph>Bank’s</emph> board, which includes members of each
                    of these institutions.<note xml:id="ftn3">

                        Stockholm University and <emph>The Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History

            <p xml:id="p3">Discussions on the possibility of developing
                        <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> started in April 2002, when the <emph>Swedish
                        Academy</emph> hosted a seminar on the digital storage of literary works. At
                    this meeting of representatives of various libraries, universities and literary
                    societies and associations, the benefits of such a digital collection of Swedish
                    literature were widely acknowledged, leading the <emph>Academy</emph> to
                    initiate an official investigation of the matter, which in turn led to the
                    successful application for a two-year pilot project (2004-2005) financed by the
                        <emph>Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences</emph>. In 2006,
                    when this project was finished, <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> took its present
                    form as a non-profit organisation,<note xml:id="ftn4">As such,
                            <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> differs from initiatives similar in scope
                        but with different publication models, such as private-public partnerships
                        and resources funded by subscription or advertisements.</note> the
                    development of which was funded by the <emph>Swedish Academy</emph>. Since 2009,
                    the <emph>Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities</emph>, the
                    National Library, and <emph>SVS</emph> have supported
                        <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> as well by making resources and materials
                    available.</p>
            <p xml:id="p4">As a Swedish enterprise, backed by Swedish (or Swedish language)
                    institutions, collecting a corpus of Swedish language texts, it is not
                    surprising that litteraturbanken.se is almost exclusively written in Swedish as
                    well. Where the website includes lengthy and informative discussions of the
                    general parameters in Swedish,<note xml:id="ftn5">I.e. an introduction to the
                        academics and institutions that are involved; its history and financial
                        resources; a clear account of how the texts in the corpus are to be
                        selected; detailed descriptions to help the user manoeuvre
                        Litteraturbanken’s many different types of content and functionalities;
                        etc.</note> this information remains difficult to access to people who do
                    not read the language. To find a short, summarizing introduction to
                        <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> in English, the user needs to navigate to a
                    Swedish language menu item (‘om LB,’ which translates as ‘about
                        <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>’), and then to a sub-level menu item called
                    ‘In English’.</p>
            <p xml:id="p5">This is all quite understandable given
                        <emph>Litteraturbanken’s</emph> national context and the language of its
                    corpus. A person who cannot even find the English introduction would be hard
                    pressed to make good use of the text collection in the first place.<note xml:id="ftn6">Not to mention the irony that comes into play when English
                        speakers complain when not everything is written or translated into their
                        own language – thus perpetuating the use of English as a lingua
                        franca.</note> But still, there is a practical concern here too. At present,
                    including more English in a collection’s interface is also a sure-fire way of
                    improving its outreach. The Norwegian <emph>eMunch</emph> project for example
                    noticed a considerable increase in their international website traffic when its
                    interface extended its official languages to English and French – despite the
                    fact that practically all of the content in its corpus is in Norwegian.<note xml:id="ftn7">Based on a personal IM communication on May 5 2017 between
                        Mats Dahlström and Hilde Bøe, head of the <emph>eMunch</emph>
                        project.</note> For <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>, such a strategy could
                    become especially pertinent if the aim is to also include translations of
                    Swedish literature in the future – which is one of the goals mentioned on its
                    English introduction page.</p>

                    to develop litteraturbanken.se into a website that holds the most important
                    Swedish literature. But rather than only <emph>representing</emph> a national
                    corpus, it seems to have taken on the challenge of <emph>extending</emph> the
                    canon as well. Exactly how the texts that make up this corpus are selected will
                    be discussed in more detail below (see: ‘Content’).</p>
            <p xml:id="p7">But <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> aims to be more than a mere archive
                    of texts. Navigating through the website it becomes clear that it also wants to
                    function as a resource for research and education;<note xml:id="ftn10">A whole
                        section of litteraturbanken.se is devoted to its ‘school’ – a platform aimed
                        at students and teachers at both secondary school and university levels
                        (see: <ref target="http://litteraturbanken.se/skola">http://litteraturbanken.se/skola</ref> ).</note> to develop and
                    disseminate technology and competences; to serve as an archive and publishing
                    platform for Swedish scholarly editions; and to make obscure or hard-to-access
                    materials available that the staff deems to be culturally significant.<note xml:id="ftn11">Rather than summarized in a list as they are presented here,
                        these diverse points of interest are mentioned individually in various
                        places across <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>’s introductory pages, and (to
                        some extent) become apparent browsing the project’s catalogue and content
                        types.</note> This way, it tries to be a resource for everyone: for
                    researchers, for teachers, for students, as well as for a heterogeneous public
                    that is just interested in (Swedish) literature in general.</p>
            <p xml:id="p8">This extensively comprehensive approach is certainly a strength:
                    acknowledging the fact that its source materials have many different qualities
                    and may serve many different purposes, a lot of time and effort is put into
                    making sure that they cater to the widest possible audience. As we will explore
                    further down in this review, however, this qualitative ambition will sometimes
                    clash with <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>’s quantitative ambitions – the
                    diversity of its content and functionalities sometimes makes it difficult to
                    fully grasp its aims and scope.</p>
            <p xml:id="p9">This is also what makes it difficult to put a label on
                        <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>. If we use Ulrike Henny and Frederike Neuber’s
                    definition of the term, <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> may be regarded as a
                    digital text collection: indeed, it is undoubtedly a ‘digital resourc[e] that
                    involve[s] the collection, structuring and enrichment of textual data’ (Henny
                    and Neuber 2017). But of course, as they acknowledge in their “Preliminary
                    Remarks,” this definition is meant to be a generic term that comprises a number
                    of different types of collections like corpora, archives, libraries,
                    repositories, databases, etc. If we take a look at the way
                        <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> self-identifies instead, we find terms like
                    resource (‘resurs’)<note xml:id="ftn12">On the website, however, this term
                        usually relates to individual objects in the collection.</note> and storage
                    place (‘lagringsplats’); in other words, <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> is
                    presented as a place where digitized versions of literary works are deposited
                    for safekeeping and consultation.</p>
            <p xml:id="p10">This could also explain why <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> calls
                    itself a ‘bank’ for Swedish literature: there is a certain analogy with safes
                    and safety deposit boxes to be found here. And with insurance policies too, as
                        <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> tries to ensure the long term sustainability
                    of its literary canon. But still, a bank is usually a more interactive space:
                    not just for deposits, but for withdrawals, loans and exchange as well. And as
                    we will argue further down in this review, the interactive aspect of
                        <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> still leaves much to be desired. So at this
                    point in time at least, perhaps <emph>The Literature ‘Trust’</emph> would be a
                    more appropriate translation than <emph>The Literature ‘Bank’</emph> –
                    especially also since deposits to the <emph>‘Bank’</emph> can only be made by
                    vetted trustees at the moment.<note xml:id="ftn13">The name
                            <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> also contains a reference to the
                        computational linguistics resource <emph>Språkbanken,</emph> hosted by the
                        University of Gothenburg. <emph>Språkbanken</emph> served as both model and
                        partner for the <emph>Swedish Literature Bank</emph> already from the start
                        (Malm, 2010, 4). As such, the name implies that
                            <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> aims to do for Swedish literature what
                            <emph>Språkbanken</emph> does for Swedish linguistics.</note>

            <p xml:id="p12">By and large, these collections share ambition and comprehensiveness
                    with <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>.<note xml:id="ftn15">Indeed, the fact that
                        these are produced and maintained at a national rather than regional or
                        institutional level, is something Espen Ore (2015, 62) refers to as a
                        possible ‘Nordic twist’ of digital text collections.</note> ADL for instance
                    houses classical Danish works that are out of copyright, based on scholarly
                    edited transcriptions, and made available as both HTML and as digital
                    facsimiles. Similar to <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>, ADL is a cooperation
                    between literary scholars, editorial societies and academies, and the National
                    Library. <emph>Bokselskap</emph> is even more similar to
                        <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> in terms of partners, literary scope, degree
                    of textual accuracy, introductory texts and other ancillary materials, type and
                    degree of markup, and publishing formats.</p>
            <p xml:id="p13">There are marked differences as well. ADL has a much smaller
                    collection and is not as technically sophisticated. <emph>Bokselskap</emph> has
                    a more heterogeneous collection than <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> – both in
                    scope and technology – and could be said to be a bit more open in the sense that
                    it is based on a blog platform, and makes available all its encoding principles
                    (including sample TEI files), a publishing plan for the upcoming years, a
                    facility to download entire works in different formats, and presentations of the
                    project in several languages.</p>
            <p xml:id="p14">
               <emph>Projekt Runeberg</emph> however differs in some important respects: a
                    collection of digitized, machine-readable Nordic classical works launched
                    already in 1992, this is a bottom-up community project based on voluntary work,
                    where <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> and the other projects mentioned above are
                    top-down, expert-based, and professional. There is in fact a considerable number
                    of voluntary crowd-based projects online, devoted to scanning printed editions
                    of classical works and transcribing them using OCR. Given the ease with which
                    this can be done, we can expect such work to continue or even increase in the
                    future. Largely, however, these are plain image and text collections with
                    minimised metadata, sporadic proof-reading (at best), little or no descriptive
                    markup, and with little or no ancillary scholarly material. Between crowd-based
                    projects on the one hand and generalized mass-digitization projects à la Google
                    Books on the other, activities such as <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> have found
                    a niche as a collection with high quality facsimiles, carefully proof-read OCR
                    transcriptions, rich metadata, advanced search and a scholarly subject expertise
                    in e.g. literary studies, book history and textual criticism.</p>

               <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> does not aim to be the publisher and storage space
                    for <emph>all</emph> Swedish literature. In the first place,
                        <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> wants to make the canon of Swedish literature
                    accessible to the general public, but also to include a range of lesser known
                    Swedish literary authors. In general, <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>
                    distinguishes between five different foci that help determine the selection of
                    its materials: 1) central authors and editions; 2) thematic or genre specific
                    collections of works; 3) individual works of significance; 4) historically
                    significant Swedish translations of works in other languages; and 5) relevant
                    modern non-fiction literature such as reference works.</p>
            <p xml:id="p16">In the ‘central authors and editions’ (1) section, we are presented
                    with a majority of the works of the most renowned Swedish authors, often based
                    on scholarly editions. The list of authors included is comprehensive, certainly
                    up to the early 20th century, from which point onwards a smaller (but steadily
                    increasing) selection of later authorships is represented, for reasons of
                    copyright. <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> emphasises that the selection of works
                    is not made on the basis of an existing list of canonical authors or works, but
                    that instead its corpus is expanded through a constant process of renegotiation
                    where both <emph>tradition</emph> and <emph>regeneration</emph> play a principal
                    role. From the start it was made clear that <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> would
                    become the home of at least two large-scale scholarly editing projects: those of
                    the complete works of both August Strindberg and Carl Jonas Love Almqvist. And
                    through collaborations with the <emph>Swedish Society for Belles-Lettres</emph>
               <note xml:id="ftn17">This society, presented at <ref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20170727081932/https://svenskavitterhetssamfundet.wordpress.com/english/">https://web.archive.org/web/20170727081932/https://svenskavitterhetssamfundet.wordpress.com/english/</ref>,
                        is the major producer and publisher of printed scholarly editions of
                        classical, post-Reformation Swedish authors.</note> and a number of
                    editorial and other scholarly projects<note xml:id="ftn18">E.g. the ongoing
                        scholarly edition of Selma Lagerlöf’s collected works. Note that the ADL and
                            <emph>Bokselskap</emph> collections (see ‘<emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>
                        in Context’) work with similar arrangements.</note> these efforts are now
                    extended to include the works of a wide range of canonical authors.
                    Interestingly, this means that <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> has gradually
                    become the <emph>de facto</emph> digital publishing and archiving platform for
                    the major Swedish scholarly editing projects – ongoing as well as finished
                    ones.</p>
            <p xml:id="p17">This section is different from <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>’s
                    self-proclaimed focus on ‘individual works of significance’ (3), where it aims
                    to add a number of works to its collection that are not quite so well-known or
                    critically acclaimed – but that nevertheless had a significant impact on, or
                    signify a good representation of, the literature of the time.<note xml:id="ftn19">‘För varje August Strindberg går det, enkelt uttryckt, ett
                        stort antal John Personne,’ <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>’s ‘about’ section
                        reads. John Personne was a Swedish author who criticized Strindberg’s work,
                        but whose own works did not yield any critical acclaim. In other words, this
                        quote suggests that for every important author there are a great number of
                        second-rate authors. Arguably, such authors (and their works and criticisms)
                        may provide crucial insights for contextualizing the more canonical authors
                        in <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>’s corpus.</note> Rather than expanding the
                    literary canon, this focus area instead aims to expand our understanding of the
                    context in which more canonical works of literature could blossom. And more of
                    such context is provided in <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>’s last two sections
                    that include important literary translations (4), and reference works (5).</p>
            <p xml:id="p18">While these goals and selection criteria are all elaborately
                    explained and illustrated in <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>’s ‘about’ page, it is
                    more difficult to see how they are put into practice in the corpus – and
                    navigable through the Graphic User Interface (GUI). Browsing the website, it
                    seems that at the moment many of these groupings are still underdeveloped and
                    not yet visible enough. A good example here is <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>’s
                    focus on thematic and genre related collections (2). To find a collection of
                    texts within a specific genre, the user needs to navigate to the
                        <emph>Litteraturskolan</emph>, where texts are grouped together as being
                    either prose or poetry.<note xml:id="ftn20">On the ‘about’ page,
                            <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> boasts that there will soon (2017–2018)
                        also be a section for drama texts available.</note> And deep inside
                        <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>’s Selma Lagerlöf Archive (‘Lagerlöfarkivet’),
                    the user can find a presentation of different themes that are present in
                    Lagerlöf’s works. But these are all hard to find, and not living up to their
                    full potential. A simple faceted genre classification should be relatively easy
                    to accommodate in the metadata,<note xml:id="ftn21"> Behind the scenes, there is
                        already the beginning of such a classification in
                            <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>’s own database files. This was confirmed
                        in an e-mail communication with staff, May 16 2017.</note> which in turn
                    would make the construction of clearer browsing pathways or genre based advanced
                    search options feasible. This problem relates to some of the usability issues
                    that will be discussed below. At this point, it suffices to say that these are
                    the areas that <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> is focusing on while it is still
                    actively expanding its corpus, even if this is not always as clearly visible as
                    such in its design.</p>
            <p xml:id="p19">More concretely, the reader of this review may be curious to know
                    how large this corpus actually is. During the first few years of its existence
                    online, the pace with which works were added to <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>
                    was quite modest, but once robust procedures and workflows were set in place
                    from around 2010 onwards, <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>’s publishing has
                    acquired considerable momentum. Given this, chances are that the collection will
                    have grown considerably by the time you are reading this review. Still, as a
                    point of reference, at the moment of writing<note xml:id="ftn22">These figures
                        were available at litteraturbanken.se on May 9 2017. For current data about
                        the corpus’s current size (in Swedish), please visit: <ref target="http://litteraturbanken.se/#!/om/statistik">http://litteraturbanken.se/#!/om/statistik</ref>. This page also
                        includes a list of the 30 works that are the most often read (counting the
                        number of times the work’s e-text version was consulted online), and the 30
                        works of which the EPUB files were downloaded the most often. We suspect
                        that the number of words presented on the website combines those of the
                        e-texts with those in the EPUB files – not counting the (untranscribed)
                        words written on the digital facsimile images, nor the OCR’d words in the
                        text layer of the PDFs.</note> its collection counted 2143 works written by
                    a total of 1326 different authors. These works are made available as online
                    readable e-texts (217.754 pages), digital facsimiles (363.684 pages), and EPUBs
                    (844 files). Combined, these works counted an impressive 117.425.313 words. And
                    in addition to this corpus of literary texts, <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> also
                    includes a number of peripheral materials that were mentioned earlier, such as
                    relevant papers and presentations, materials prepared for students, pupils and
                    teachers (including a Swedish lexicon for literary terms), and a sound archive
                    of texts that are read out loud by Swedish celebrities (these are also made
                    available in the form of an iTunes podcast).<note xml:id="ftn23">See: <ref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20170727082110/https://itunes.apple.com/se/podcast/litteraturbankens-upplasningar/id1180639320?l=sv">https://web.archive.org/web/20170727082110/https://itunes.apple.com/se/podcast/litteraturbankens-upplasningar/id1180639320?l=sv</ref>.</note>
                    In other words, <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> offers its materials in a wide
                    range of formats, and individual items in the corpus are often (but not always)
                    published in more than one of these.</p>

            <head>Usability</head>
            <p xml:id="p20">This brings us to the discussion of the way in which the user may
                    interact with the materials that <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> has to offer. In
                    this regard, it may be interesting to note that the initial project was created
                    on the basis of an actual user need rather than a more general academic
                    interest. In addition to the affiliated members that were mentioned in our
                    introduction, <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>’s board also includes Swedish author
                    Sven Lindqvist, who is credited with the idea behind the project. Missing ready
                    access to Swedish literature on his travels, Lindqvist reportedly provided the
                        <emph>Swedish Academy</emph> with the incentive to hold the aforementioned
                    seminar that would get the project off the ground in 2002. On the one hand, this
                    would suggest that <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> has a strong incentive to put a
                    lot of effort into usability and design issues. On the other hand, it may also
                    explain why more advanced analytical and interactive functionalities are not yet
                    fully developed at the moment (as will be more elaborately discussed below). In
                    the terms of Krista Stinne Greven Rasmussen’s recent typology of reader roles
                    for scholarly editions, the graphical user interface of
                        <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> will cater to an audience of
                        <emph>readers,</emph> rather than to one of <emph>users</emph> – let alone
                        <emph>co-workers</emph> (Rasmussen 2016, 127).</p>

                        Interface – which has recently been extensively updated. As a vehicle for
                        human-computer interaction, the first aspect of this interface that we
                        should discuss is probably the website’s navigation structure – which is
                        organized in a menu on the left hand side of the website, below its logo
                        (see <ref type="crossref" target="#img1">Fig. 1</ref>). This menu can be a
                        bit confusing for the first-time visitor, because it includes different ways
                        to search different parts (or aspects) of <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>’s
                        archive, and there is some redundancy here as well. Thankfully, however, the
                        best place to start browsing the archive is rather self-explanatorily named
                            <emph>biblioteket</emph> (or: ‘the library’); a link that is
                        conveniently located at the top of the menu. If you are looking for a
                        specific author or work, you can find any item in the archive through this
                        page’s search bar.<note xml:id="ftn24">This includes all the audio files in
                            the sound archive (‘ljudarkivet’), and any work used in
                                <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>’s school (‘litteraturskolan’). It does
                            not, however, include the introductions etc. listed in the website’s
                                <emph>presentationer</emph> section.</note> And if you just want to
                        explore the text collection in general, there are plenty of lists with
                        suggested items (such as <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>’s most popular
                        authors or works, or the newest additions to the archive). You can also
                        refine your search by (de)selecting specific text formats, be they e-texts,
                        facsimiles, EPUBs, or PDF files.<note xml:id="ftn25">It is not possible to

                  </figure> Instead of going to the <emph>biblioteket</emph> page, the user
                        can also try the <emph>snabbsökning</emph> link (or: ‘quick search’) a few
                        menu-items down the list. Except for the list with suggested items and the
                        option to include or exclude certain formats (neither of which is accessible
                        through <emph>snabbsökning</emph>), the functionality of this page is almost
                        identical to that of <emph>biblioteket</emph>: it summons a search bar that
                        allows the user to look for specific authors or titles in the archive. The
                        difference here is that by clicking on <emph>snabbsökning</emph> the user
                        does not navigate away from the page she is currently watching (see <ref type="crossref" target="#img2">Fig. 2</ref>). Instead, that page is
                        blurred, and the quick search bar is projected as a pop-up on top of that
                        page – which the user can quickly return to by clicking outside of the
                        search bar (and in the ‘blurred’ area) like she never left.
                            <emph>Snabbsökning</emph>’s pop-up search bar is a welcome feature on
                        litteraturbanken.se, because it functions as the website’s fixed search
                            bar.<note xml:id="ftn26">Such a fixed search bar would indeed be
                            difficult to integrate into the website, given that its layout changes
                            considerably depending on the type of content the user is reading (see
                            below).</note> Still, offering two almost identical search bars on
                        different locations in the website feels somewhat redundant. While there are
                        small differences between the two search bars, these are not
                            advertised.<note xml:id="ftn27">These differences include 1) that
                                <emph>snabbsökning</emph> has a dropdown autocomplete feature where
                                <emph>biblioteket</emph> does not; and, more importantly, 2) that
                            the search results of <emph>biblioteket</emph> seem to be more thorough
                            than those of <emph>snabbsökning</emph>. It appears that the search
                            engine behind the <emph>biblioteket</emph> search bar also takes section
                            titles inside text-items into account, where the
                                <emph>snabbsökning</emph> search bar does not. In our opinion,
                                <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>’s ideal search bar would combine
                            features of both: the dropdown autocomplete function from
                                <emph>snabbsökning</emph>, and the more thorough search (and
                            refinement) settings from <emph>biblioteket</emph>.</note> This is
                        confusing for the user, who is left to find this difference out on her own,
                        and (failing that) may unwittingly miss out on some interesting search
                        results. Choosing one of these search options and abandoning the other would
                        perhaps be the more user-friendly option.<note xml:id="ftn28">For example by
                            treating the <emph>biblioteket</emph> page purely as an index page;
                            and/or by merging all the different search bars
                                (<emph>biblioteket</emph>, <emph>snabbsökning</emph>, and <emph>sök

                        Instead, <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> provides a corpus of all of its texts
                        to <emph>Språkbanken</emph>, which allows some basic text analysis of the

                            <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>’s corpus as a whole, however, will never
                        be downloadable by individuals, because of copyright issues.<note xml:id="ftn31">Because <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> includes a lot of

                        since the non-commercial restriction has recently come into some disrepute
                        in academic circles,<note xml:id="ftn33">The ‘non-commercial’ appendix to
                            Creative Commons licenses has been heavily criticized for being too
                            restrictive, considerably limiting the source’s potential for
                            reusability (see for instance Robinson 2013). While this is true, we
                            appreciate that such a CC BY-NC-SA license can already be difficult to
                            obtain for works that are not yet in the public domain (see also Dillen
                            and Neyt 2016). That is why we think <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>’s
                            flexible approach to licensing makes for a good compromise between
                            accessibility and reusability.</note> it is encouraging to see that
                            <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> actually employs a much more flexible
                        approach to copyright licensing. Many of the collection’s facsimile images,
                        for instance, are released under a CC0 license: effectively dedicating their
                        rights to the public domain, proper authorship attribution is encouraged but
                        not required.<note xml:id="ftn34">The Swedish text clarifying the copyright
                            license at the bottom of the copyright pop-up in <ref type="crossref" target="#img4">Figure 4</ref> can be translated as: ‘This work is
                            free from known copyright restrictions. In case of use, we ask you to
                            refer to Gothenburg University – Litteraturbanken.se’. It is unclear if
                            the em-dash here means ‘and’ or ‘signed’ – but since authorship
                            attribution is requested rather than required this makes no legal
                            difference, and the (re)user may be encouraged to refer to both.</note>

                  </figure> The core of <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>’s text collection, as
                        mentioned before, is its large archive of e-texts. These are almost
                        documentary editions of the Swedish texts, where much attention went into
                        letting the e-text resemble the primary source as much as possible (see
                        ‘Methods’). As goes for <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>’s entire website, the
                        e-texts look aesthetically pleasing, with a minimal design, nice fonts, etc.
                        (see Fig. 5). In the sidebar on the righthand side, the user finds some
                        basic navigational and search functionalities.<note xml:id="ftn36">The
                            navigational options are <emph>gå bakåt en del</emph> (previous
                            section); <emph>gå till nästa del</emph> (next section); <emph>gå till

                                <emph>Innehållsförteckning</emph> (a linked table of contents). The
                            user can also move to immediately preceding or following pages using the
                            arrows in the sidebar, or (as explained alongside those arrows) the
                            arrows on her keyboard. The search options are <emph>sök i verket</emph>
                            (search the work), or <emph>sök i författarens texter</emph> (search the
                            author’s works). The former option opens up a mini search bar on the
                            same page; the latter option transports the user to the advanced search
                            page.</note> There is also a link to the <emph>läsfokus</emph> view
                        (‘focussed reading’) that removes the clutter (i.e. the two sidebars) and
                        gives the user some limited options for manipulating the way the text is
                        visualized: using a larger or smaller font, switching between night-mode or
                        day-mode, and minimal navigation controls (see <ref type="crossref" target="#img6">Fig. 6</ref>).<note xml:id="ftn37">The word
                                <emph>limited</emph> really is key here: as may become even more
                            clear when we discuss the facsimile view, <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>
                            goes to considerable length in controlling the visual display of its
                            materials. In the case of the e-texts there are, for example, no options
                            to change the text’s typeface, or to re-flow the text for optimising the
                            screen real estate on the user’s side. Of course, these options may
                            become accessible through the user’s EPUB reader – if copyright
                            restrictions allow for the work to be published in this format in the
                            first place.</note>
               </p>
               <p xml:id="p26">Almost as an easter-egg feature for the e-texts, the user can
                        also look up the meaning of individual words in the text in SAOB, the
                            <emph>Svenska Akademins Ordbok</emph> (i.e. the Swedish equivalent of
                        the <emph>Oxford English Dictionary</emph>) by double-clicking on that
                            word.<note xml:id="ftn38">More precisely, double-clicking any word in
                            the e-text conjures up a looking-glass icon, which in turn conjures up a
                            pop-up window (on click) that displays the entry in SAOB. The only place
                            where the existence of this feature is hinted at is halfway through
                                <emph>Litteraturbanken’s</emph> ‘help’ section – see <ref target="http://litteraturbanken.se/om/hjalp">http://litteraturbanken.se/om/hjalp</ref>, specifically its section
                                <emph>ordböcker</emph> (‘dictionaries’) section. This seems too
                            obscure a place to describe such a useful feature that the user is
                            unlikely to stumble upon accidentally – or would be hard-pressed to
                            replicate if she did.</note>

                        source documents available on its website in the form of facsimile images
                        (manuscripts, printed books, etc. – see examples in <ref type="crossref" target="#img7">Fig. 7</ref> and <ref type="crossref" target="#img8">8</ref>). These high-quality images with usually progressively free

                  </figure> What becomes perhaps even clearer in
                        <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>’s facsimile view, is that its developers seem
                        to make an effort to try and keep the user on their website – instead of
                        harvesting its data and manipulating it on their own computer, for instance.
                        While the facsimile images can be freely downloaded (and usually reused)
                        through the regular browser functionalities<note xml:id="ftn41">For example
                            by right-clicking on the image and selecting ‘Save Image’ (or an

                            desktop.</note> this has to be done page by page, and is not facilitated
                        for the user by means of a download link. Similarly, for the e-texts, it is
                        impossible to print the whole text of a work for off-screen reading, for
                        instance. While the latter may be a limitation imposed by the copyright
                        holders, the former should be an easy feature to add to the website
                        (especially in the case of the CC0 images) that could drastically improve
                        the user’s experience. Other ways in which the website’s user-friendliness
                        could be improved would be by allowing the e-text view and the facsimile
                        view to interact with each other instead of being two completely separate
                        views (see also ‘Methods’);<note xml:id="ftn42">Once inside a work, the user
                            now has to leave the page, go to the introductory page for the work or
                            the author, choose the different view (facsimile or e-text) and go down
                            to the relevant page from there. This is of course cumbersome when a
                            user wants to see what a particular text passage looked like in the
                            facsimile of a manuscript or printed edition. Links between equivalent
                            pages in both views, or (perhaps even better) a side-by-side view that
                            integrates both the e-text and the facsimile image would go a long way
                            to resolve this issue (see also ‘Methods’).</note> and (especially for
                        the facsimile view) by adding some kind of scroller or thumbnail mode to
                        allow the user to quickly find a specific page in the work. Finally, some
                        way for the user to manipulate the images in the browser (e.g. rotating
                        images, which would be especially useful in cases like Figure 8) would also
                        be a great addition to the facsimile view.</p>
               <p xml:id="p29">To conclude we can say that – given the inevitable copyright

                        collection of Swedish texts that are presented in a slick interface that
                        provides a pleasant reading experience (especially in the case of the
                        e-texts). But at the same time we find the interface lacking when it comes
                        to the integration of and communication between

                        of qualitative materials, some of the <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>’s
                        potential as a whole (e.g. as linked data) remains untapped. Less urgently,
                        perhaps, it is also a pity that <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> does not make
                        more use of web 2.0 features:<note xml:id="ftn44">Given the low degree of
                            user interaction possibilities, the fact that the website is completely
                            JavaScript dependent seems like an unnecessary technical requirement on
                            the user(‘s browser) as well.</note> the user cannot edit, contribute,
                        comment, or annotate any of the texts in the collection, nor can she
                        download TEI files (see ‘Methods’) for editing and re-use. With the addition
                        of such features and the development of an API, for instance,
                            <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> could truly fulfil its aim to be a ‘bank’:
                        allowing for its data to be used and reused by external projects through
                        aggregation, e.g. by building new and better visualization tools for the
                        data. It is not hard to imagine such services emerging as coral reefs in
                        symbiosis with litteraturbanken.se. To reach its full potential, we believe
                        it should be possible to easily export data from and import data into
                            <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>.<note xml:id="ftn45">While we appreciate
                            that the variety of copyright licenses may make it impossible for

                            exportable, it should be possible to at least provide this option for

            <p xml:id="p30">In the preceding section, we had a look at some usability features
                    of litteraturbanken.se and concluded that it offers a variety of formats and
                    view modes in an aesthetically pleasing interface. But how are these views and
                    formats actually produced? In this section, we will take a peek behind the
                    scenes and look at workflows and methods. The information in this chapter on
                    Methods draws partly on the research that Mats Dahlström and Johan Eklund
                    conducted in 2011 as part of their evaluation of the project in Swedish, but has
                    been supplemented during subsequent updates and communication with staff of
                        <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>. In particular, private email communication
                    with the staff during this review study supplied additional information while
                    also confirming that the workflow is still in place.<note xml:id="ftn46">We are
                        grateful that the <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> staff was so helpful and
                        generous in supplying this kind of information. Still, as we will come back
                        to in our conclusion, more of this information should be readily made
                        available on the website for the general public, since a better
                        understanding of these practices would help the user understand and gauge
                        the relation between the source documents and their digital surrogates on
                        litteraturbanken.se.</note>

               <head>Workflow</head>
               <p xml:id="p31">The workflow of <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> is pretty
                        straightforward. Once an adequate physical copy for a selected work has been
                        chosen as a source (see ‘Contents’), it is subjected to image capture
                        through scanning or photographing. The image files are then run through a
                        transcription process, either by using OCR or by transcribing the text
                        manually. The transcription text is subjected to careful proofreading and
                        then imported into a database and encoded in TEI-XML, from which
                        presentation files in HTML (i.e. the e-text) or EPUB are generated using XSL
                        pre-transformation. In addition, some of the image files are published as
                        digital facsimiles, and <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> also publishes some
                        material as PDF files (with searchable OCR’ed text; so-called image front
                        transcriptions). Finally, litteraturbanken.se is also being used as a
                        publishing and archiving platform for smaller collections digitized and
                        encoded elsewhere, in particular from ongoing Swedish scholarly editing
                        projects.</p>
               <p xml:id="p32">To many of the authorships, works and to some extent genres,
                            <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> also writes or commissions expert
                        introductions, comments and didactic resources. As for selecting the primary
                        source (or copy-text) to digitize and edit, the main principle is to choose
                        a copy from the first printed edition, and not to modernize the spelling.
                        Further, the aim is to have the transcription replicate the graphic form of
                        the source as much as possible, thus preserving line breaks, margins,
                        initials, blank pages etc. However, some source document’s paratextual
                        elements like blurbs are discarded.</p>
               <p xml:id="p33">Essentially, this workflow is similar to the way in which the
                        average digital scholarly edition operates – and thus probably quite
                        familiar to the RIDE reader. It is also akin to the production principles of
                        most digital collections housed by memory institutions and universities,
                        although <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> is considerably more text-oriented
                        (where the standard digital collection of classical works produced by a
                        library is more image-oriented), both for the production and the publication
                        of its materials.</p>

               <head>Image Capture</head>
               <p xml:id="p34">As for image capture, <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> mainly
                        commissions digital facsimiles from the major Swedish research libraries, in
                        particular the University Library in Gothenburg and the National Library in
                        Stockholm. Efforts are made to set uniform quality level benchmarks with the
                        libraries. The image quality is very high, and the commissioned materials
                        are delivered in several versions varying in resolution and size. These
                        versions are published on the website as facsimiles, and enable users to
                        zoom in on the object (not dynamically, but by selecting one of several
                        predefined versions). For the facsimiles, <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>
                        provides information about the specific physical copy that was used as
                        source for the digital reproduction, along with full bibliographical
                        information and library shelfmark.</p>
               <p xml:id="p35">The <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> staff also performs in-house
                        image capture. These internally produced image files (usually scans) are of
                        lower quality than the commissioned images and are primarily used for
                        pre-publication work, but rarely for direct publication together with the
                        encoded transcriptions. Because of their lower quality they do not meet the
                        quality requirements set by <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> to be published as
                        digital facsimiles. To an outsider, however, it would not seem a far stretch
                        to either put these scans online anyway with a quality caveat, or to raise
                        their quality level only slightly in order to be able to publish them as
                        facsimiles – this would be of great value to the users, not in the least if
                            <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> would consider integrating a synoptic view
                        where facsimiles and transcriptions are presented side by side,<note xml:id="ftn47">Such synoptic views have become fashionable in many
                            digital scholarly editions, e.g. the editions of the van Gogh

                        text is captured using OCR, a process that is often outsourced to external
                        partners. The transcription texts are then meticulously proof-read by the
                            <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> staff, most of them being literary,
                        linguistic and textual scholars themselves with an expertise in the kind of

                        the editorial choice to let the final e-text reflect the source text both
                        graphically and textually, special attention is paid in the transcription
                        phase to cases where e.g. authorially intentional line breaks have been
                        dismissed by the OCR software, or where the OCR dictionaries have modernized

                        This part of the work is excellent, and lays the groundwork for various
                        kinds of data transformation, export and aggregation possibilities. The
                        encoding is a combination of machine-based (using genre or author specific
                        templates) and manual encoding. The templates (called text ‘factories’)
                        automatically mark up a selected section of text with genre specific
                        pre-settings. This markup is then checked manually and edited extensively.
                        According to staff this procedure works well, and requires only a few hours
                        of manual work for the encoding of a novel of average length.<note xml:id="ftn51">E-mail communication with staff members of

                        settings, principles and workflow routines are well documented and described

                        prepared for staff changes or for data export. As of yet, the TEI-XML files
                        are only used for pre-publication work, i.e. as the basis for the HTML and

            <head>Conclusion</head>
            <p xml:id="p38">To conclude, we can say that <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> is an
                    ambitious endeavour, whose principal goal to make the most important works of
                    Swedish literature widely and freely available (accompanied by commissioned
                    presentations and comments on authors and works by subject experts) can only be
                    applauded. Having gained considerable momentum in its publishing pace, it is
                    well on its way to reach this goal: an absolute majority of the canonical
                    Swedish authorships and works in the public domain are now adequately
                    represented in <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> in the form of quality sealed
                    versions, subjected to scholarly scrutiny. And each month that goes by, yet
                    another important authorship seems to have been added to the corpus and
                    presented to <emph>Litteraturbanken’s</emph> readers.</p>
            <p xml:id="p39">It is a well-networked enterprise that collaborates with other
                    literary, linguistic, and editorial projects across Sweden; and especially its
                    extensive cooperation with <emph>Språkbanken</emph> has paved the way for a high
                    degree of competence with regard to computational linguistics, database and
                    corpora work, and a high standard for deep encoding.<note xml:id="ftn52">Another
                        example of the conscientiousness of <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>’s
                        collaboration is the fact that the file names and URLs for each page on
                        litteraturbanken.se are linked to their respective records in LIBRIS (see
                        ‘Methods’).</note> The transcriptions are meticulously proof-read, and
                    rendered with a high level of concern for textual and graphical authenticity
                    with regard to the source documents. To accomplish this (and to maintain the
                    high level of quality for the published facsimiles as well),
                        <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> has an extensive array of in-house
                    documentation detailing their well established routines for the project’s
                    workflow, encoding standards, publication practices, (sub-)versioning and
                    backups with regular log data collections etc. In short,
                        <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> is a well-oiled machine that provides a large
                    and qualitative collection of Swedish texts.</p>
            <p xml:id="p40">As we see it, however, the project’s main problem is that it tries
                    to do too many things at once to be able to do all of them right. Of course,
                    since it is still under development it would be unfair to treat it as a finished
                    project, and we are confident that many of our concerns will be addressed in the
                    near future. Still, as it stands at the moment of writing, by attempting to
                    satisfy its qualitative and quantitative needs simultaneously,
                        <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph> does not fully meet one of the field’s most
                    fundamental requirements: providing ways to ensure the editors’ accountability
                    for the edited texts (and images) that it has to offer.<note xml:id="ftn53"> As
                        Patrick Sahle recently argued in his contribution to Driscoll and Pierazzo’s
                            <emph>Digital Scholarly Editing: Theories and practices</emph>: ‘[t]he
                        most basic exigency in traditional editing – <emph>State your rules and

                        all digital editing (Sahle 2016, 36; emphasis in original).</note> This is
                    an issue that could be remedied by, for instance, making a detailed general
                    account of editorial methods, principles and digitization practices more readily
                    available; by providing more tools for textual scholars to compare the edited
                    texts to their original source materials; and by allowing researchers to read or
                    download individual TEI-XML files. Due to the high quality of the rigorous
                    editorial work and the well-considered construction of the infrastructure and
                    workflows, most of this documentation is already present inside of
                        <emph>Litteraturbanken</emph>, even if it is not yet made available to the
                    users. If only the team would take this one step further, they could transform
                    what is already an impressive, vast, open access collection of high quality
                    digital texts into the genuine digital scholarly editing platform it seems to
                    aspire to become.</p>
