            <p>This article addresses the Beckett Digital Manuscript Project, an evolving project,
               currently comprising a series of digital genetic editions of Samuel Beckett’s
               bilingual literary drafts and a digital library. Following the genetic school of
               editing, the project’s goal is to explore and represent as fully as possible the
               evolutionary dynamics of Beckett’s composition process. The robust editorial
               framework alongside the sophisticated technical development and design of the project
               succeed to manage a vast amount of complex primary material and to offer an insight
               into Beckett's writing, by enabling multiple processing of facsimiles, transcriptions
               and comparisons of variants in a user-friendly way. The 'Beckett Digital Library'
               further enables a comprehensive approach to the concept of textual genesis and to
               Beckett's intellectual influences. Moreover, the project contains exemplary
               documentation as well as a number of spin-off outputs. However, key improvements
               could still be made mainly to its publication and business strategies, currently a
               subscription model, in order to increase the access to the project and its further
               contribution to the scholarly community.</p>

            <p xml:id="p1">The Beckett Digital Manuscript Project (BDMP) stands as an exemplary case
               in the fields of textual scholarship, genetic criticism and digital editing. Before
               discussing the BDMP in the light of digital genetic editing of modern manuscripts, it
               is useful to briefly sketch an overview of the history and goals of genetic criticism
               and then to place and further argue on the BDMP’s contribution within this scholarly
                  area.<note xml:id="ftn1">I would like to thank Dirk van Hulle and Vincent Neyt who
                  kindly offered me login permission to the BDMP in order to compile this review.

                  with her/his constructive comments. The research leading to these results has
                  received funding from the People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European
                  Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013/ under REA grant agreement n°

            <p xml:id="p2">The invention of print not only heralded the emergence of the printed
               book, but also the acquisition of another textual asset: the modern manuscript.<note xml:id="ftn2">The invention of print marks a radical difference in nature,
                  production and functionalities between modern and classical or medieval
                  manuscripts: the ancient/medieval manuscript is a copy made by a scribe intended
                  for public dissemination, while in contrast the modern manuscript contains notes
                  and preparatory material produced by the writer himself in order to use them
                  during the production phase of the work (see also Lebrave 2006). Regarding their
                  scholarly value and use, as ancient manuscripts contain scribal errors and
                  corruptions as a result of the process of repetition and transmission, the main
                  scholarly task is to collect and examine the variants and to establish a text that
                  corresponds to the original intentions of the author. In contrast, the modern
                  manuscript contains the different stages of the writing process, and thus
                  "actually destabilizes the notion of ‘text’ and shakes the exclusive hold of the
                  textual model" (Deppman, Ferrer &amp; Groden 2004, 11).</note> While in the 19th
               and early 20th century interest in writers’ working manuscripts was limited to
               concerns for their preservation, in the second half of the 20th century literary
               drafts evolved into a distinctive object of scholarly research. Modern literary
               drafts became at once an editorial headache and a challenge to modern textual
               scholars; it might not be an exaggeration to suggest that literary drafts became the
               scholarly <emph>lieu par excellence</emph> through which to map parallel developments
               in literary theory, textual criticism and computer science.</p>
            <p xml:id="p3">A series of seismic conjunctures in literary theory – and particularly
               the influence of structural linguistics and post-structuralism which "shed light upon
               the relations that form among, and give meaning to, all the elements of the text"
               (Hay 1979, 230-231) – led to a substantial overhaul and problematization of the
               concepts of textuality, the materiality of writing, the status of the author as well
               as the nature of (textual) representation. This shift of interest from the literary
               object as a final product to aspects of the writing process (<emph>écriture</emph>)
               and to mechanisms of textual production initially served as the ideal repertoire for
               the study of Heinrich Heine’s manuscripts, acquired by the Bibliothèque Nationale de
               France in 1966. The study of literary drafts gradually gained institutional support
               in France (Centre d’ Analyse des Manuscrits (1976) &amp; Institute des textes et
               manuscrits modernes (1982)) while the collaborative research environment inaugurated
               a scientific scholarly approach to textual genesis, i.e. genetic criticism
                  (<emph>critique génétique</emph>).</p>
            <p xml:id="p4">The school of genetic criticism signals a new direction in the field of
               textual studies by locating its main object of research not in the
               ‘text-as-we-used-to-know-it’ but rather in the writers’ working manuscripts, what
               Bellemin-Nöel terms "avant-textes" (Bellemin-Nöel 1972). It thus elaborates a textual
               theory of "writing poetics" rather than one of "textual poetics" (Debray Genette
               1979, 24) and an editing model for "manuscript genetics" rather than one for ‘textual
               genetics’ (De Biasi 1996, 37-38). These ‘avant-textes’ transcend traditional textual
               typologies and are studied as "complex semiotic objects" as they illuminate authorial
               alterations or variants, the dynamic traces of the writing process, which are the
               markers of a new textuality with a distinct ‘chronotoposensitivity’ (Ferrer 1998,
               262-263).</p>
            <p xml:id="p5">Given that genetic criticism’s focal point is "not to produce a printable
               text but rather […] to seize and describe a movement, a process of writing that can
               only be approximately inferred from the existing documents" (Deppman, Ferrer &amp;
               Groden 2004, 11), the genetic critics’ primary assignments are the following: on the
               one hand, the genetic task is to make manuscripts readable and accessible, to
               decipher the material evidence found there; on the other hand, its broader task is to
               attempt a critical interpretation of the composition history and to reconstruct and
               analyse the operations involved over the course of the genetic stages. This spatial
               deciphering and temporal unfolding of the writing process can be observed both on a
               macrogenetic level, by compiling a succession/evolution of genetic documents/versions
               in the ‘dossier génétique’, and on a microgenetic level, by reconstructing the
               genetic relations between the authorial variants in each genetic document separately.
               A full ‘lecture génétique’ is the product of these two procedures and constitutes "a
               form of criticism of its own" (Deppman, Ferrer &amp; Groden 2004, 2).</p>
            <p xml:id="p6">Though various forms of genetic editions of drafts (e.g. ‘literal or
               diplomatic transcription’, ‘linear diplomatic transcription’, ‘synoptic or linear
               edition’) were proposed and tested over the years, all of them have been criticised
               for their inability, due to the codex-based limitations, to adequately represent the
               dynamic process of writing. If it is the textual material in question that
               increasingly becomes a "stimulant […] to the pursuit of new […] editorial tools"
               (McGann 2001, 81), then computational technologies have, since 1970, acted as
               catalysts for the development of a new editorial model for genetic textuality. From
               early computer software programs able to categorise authorial alterations in the form
               of lists (‘automatic edition’) to hypertextual systems capable of hosting,
               visualising and navigating the multitude of pathways through the whole genetic
               dossier and lately to proposals for a genetic encoding scheme able to mark up
               documentary features and the temporal evolution of the writing flow, all these
               attempts conduce to confirm Gabler’s argument that "the editing of manuscripts [...]
               belongs exclusively in the digital medium, as it can only there be exercised
               comprehensively" (Gabler 2010, 52).</p>
            <p xml:id="p7">Genetic criticism has, from the offset, been related with modernist
               writers’ archives and works. Modernist authors themselves vested their efforts in
               exploring novel techniques with which to express the experience of reality and thus
               cultivated a profound sensitivity to the materiality and the temporality of their
               composition by "emphasiz[ing] ‘writing’ as a verb rather that a noun" (van Hulle
               2004, 47). Such a rationale might explain the complex composition and publication
               history of their works but also why many of them preserved and donated their drafts
               to libraries and archives, with the implicit desire that their texts should be
               studied as more than finished products. Given that the Modernist period constituted
               the Golden Age of manuscripts, McGann’s and especially Bornstein’s work in Modernist
               studies and textual scholarship proved instrumental in directing scholarly and
               editorial attention to the ‘bibliographic (non-literary) codes’ of Modernist works
               (Yeats, Pound, Joyce, Beckett), by pointing to the "semantics of [...] materiality"
               of their literary production and publication (Bornstein 2001, 46). Not surprisingly,
               thus, digital genetic criticism is a growing field of interest in Modernist
               studies.</p>

            <head>Digital editing of Beckett’s bilingual drafts</head>
            <p xml:id="p8">Among Modernist writers, Samuel Beckett stands as a "paradigmatic author
               of manuscript genetics" (van Hulle 2008, 192). Samuel Beckett (1906-1989), the Irish
               avant-garde writer who spent most of his life in Paris, was one of the 20th century's
               most original and important literary figures, a Nobel laureate (1969) and a
               distinctive voice of European Modernism. Beckett’s work, pluralistic in its
               development, genuinely transcends genre distinctions (prose, poetry, drama, radio
               plays, etc.) as well as norms of literary expression, while creatively interrogating
               the language vehicle (French, English). Beckett preserved an abundance of material
               evidence of the genesis of his works; so much that, according to Dirk van Hulle, "the
               writing process becomes an integral part of his work" (van Hulle, 2008, 121).</p>
            <p xml:id="p9">The study of Beckett’s archive, containing bilingual heterogeneous
               literary drafts (holograph manuscripts, typescripts, notebooks) as well as secondary
               material (the author’s library and miscellanea), coupled with the attempt to create
               scholarly editions of his works by taking into account the various iterations from
               the manuscript to the final form exceed the textual and bibliographic fields and
               function as a way to understand main literary aspects of Beckett’s oeuvre. What a
               genetic study of the composition history of these works reveals is a poetic anxiety
               regarding revision, authorial re-interpretation and self-translation, (in)completion,
               and a fascination with deliberate false beginnings and dead ends, lacunae and
               paralipomena. All these are textual materializations of Beckett’s thematic despair
               and failure "which in a paradoxical way turns it into an even more radical chaosmos"
               (van Hulle 2008, 193). In addition, all these genetic traces bear witness to an
               extremely persistent and ingenious writer, as "writing is for Samuel Beckett an
               excruciatingly arduous task and he typically uses the personal challenges of this
               task as raw material for his fiction" (Smith 1982, 107). While print format
               limitations prevent a genetic study of Beckett’s bilingual drafts, digital technology
               offers the means to document in full his writing mechanisms dynamically and the
               complex evolutionary dynamics of his writing. To this end, the Beckett Digital
               Manuscript Project (BDMP) stands as the first to take up such an undertaking.</p>

               </figure> The Beckett Digital Manuscript Project (<ref type="crossref" target="#img1">Fig. 1</ref>) is a joint initiative of the Centre for Manuscript Genetics
               (University of Antwerp), the Beckett International Foundation (University of Reading)
               and the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center (Austin, Texas) additionally
               supported by Beckett’s Estate and by further sponsors in national and international
               funding bodies (ERC). The project was launched in 2011 and plans to evolve in a
               modular way: the initial plan is to offer 26 research modules of an equivalent number
               of Beckett’s works in the digital archive together with a series of 26 ancillary
               printed volumes, "analyzing the genesis of the texts contained in the corresponding
               manuscripts and modules". As of October 2016, the website showcases three research
               modules of Beckett’s work, a Digital Library and four accompanying print monographs.
               The BDMP has evolved under the direction of Dirk van Hulle and Mark Nixon, while the
               technical implementation is overseen by Vincent Neyt; a full list of contributors and
               credits can also be found in the ‘Colophon’. Last spring, the project was submitted
               to a total interface refurbishment, which included the addition of the Beckett
               Digital Library module, so this critical account seems to be timely.</p>
            <p xml:id="p11">The genetic study of Beckett’s bilingual manuscripts has a long and
               interesting pre-history, given, for instance, the 'in-house' genetic edition of four
               works by Samuel Beckett (a cooperation between the Universities of Antwerp and the
               University of Reading) and the noteworthy Garland series of bilingual variorum
               editions of Beckett’s works edited by Charles Krance (Krance 1996). Nevertheless, the
               inefficiency of complex print-based analytical tools that they employed (synoptical
               apparatus, variant synopses) forbids from the outset a comprehensive and in-depth
               comparative analysis of Beckett’s oeuvre. The BDMP, as stated in the ‘Series
               preface’, aims to overcome these inadequacies of the codex form in length and
               functionality and to "function both as a digital archive and as a genetic edition […]
               in that [it] digitally reunites the manuscripts of Samuel Beckett's works and
               facilitates the exploration and examination of the genetic dossier from diverse
               perspectives". This ‘tension’ between the digital reunification of manuscripts and
               the computationally enabled critical reconstruction of the dynamics of Beckett’s
               composition process, – also evident in the linguistic manoeuvre between the label
               ‘archive’, found in the URL, and the actual name of the project – is what, in my
               view, makes of the BDMP an exemplary attempt of a lecture génétique.</p>
         </div>
         <div xml:id="div3">
            <head>Editorial strategy and representation of primary sources</head>
            <p xml:id="p12">According to its main editorial statement, the BDMP situates itself
               within the tradition of genetic criticism by focusing on the "critical aspect [of
               the] reconstruction of the dynamics of the composition process", which also reveals
               an encounter with the principles of textual scholarship. The goal of the BDMP is
               mirrored in this double task of genetic criticism: the accessible
               representation/transcription and the critical analysis of textual genesis, the
               abovementioned tug-of-war between archive and edition. To this end, facsimiles and
               full transcriptions of all versions of the works are provided while the data
               modelling and content design further enable the user to zoom on and compare any
               textual unit to the corresponding unit in all of the other versions in both
               languages. A literary and historical introduction to Beckett’s oeuvre would also be
               welcome here; this absence can be explained by the focus on a specialised scholarly
               audience, already familiar with his work and place in literary history.</p>
            <p xml:id="p13">Facsimiles of Beckett’s drafts, currently under the Estate of Samuel
               Beckett’s copyright and dispersed across various libraries around the globe, are
               presented in high-quality digital images with a watermark containing the copyright
               disclaimer notice. The archival identification (numbering) of the facsimiles is
               conducted following holding libraries’ systems while a full bibliographical
               description based on the existing manuscript catalogues is also provided.</p>
            <p xml:id="p14">As far as the transcription of the drafts is concerned, the BDMP offers
               two different methods of transcription alongside the facsimile of each original
               draft: a topographic/document-oriented transcription and a linear/text-oriented
               transcription. The topographic transcription aims to graphically mimic the layout of
               the original document (the font, the type of paper, and writing tools). Without
               prioritising either interpretation and through its very content architecture and
               interface, the BDMP suggests the combination of those two transcriptions, arguing
               that "they are both transformations, and the combination of a topographic with a
               linear transcription proves to be an adequate way to perfect the approximation of the
               original". Or, in van Hulle’s words, "by means of ‘code switches’ between an
               image-based and a text-based approach (analogous to McGann’s bibliographical and
               linguistic codes), digital philology […] contribute[s] to an enhanced bibliographical
               awareness" (van Hulle 2009, 454).</p>
            <p xml:id="p15">By employing a sophisticated encoding scheme and a well designed content
               architecture, the BDMP succeeds in genuinely and flexibly visualising and processing
               the primary material in a variety of contexts and ways, based on Ted Nelson's
               "principle of transclusion" (Nelson 1993) or, as Sahle terms it, on its "modularised
               structure" (Sahle 2016, 29): different visualisations of each document's data and of
               the text’s evolution, dynamic comparisons of compositional and translation
               variants.</p>
         </div>
         <div xml:id="div4">
            <head>Data modelling</head>
            <p xml:id="p16">These editorial decisions are also reflected in the digital edition’s
               encoding design, which is based on Extensible Markup Language (XML) using the
               Guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI P5); the encoding is validated
               against a customized schema created by Roma. The robust documentation of the digital
               edition coupled with the fact that the registered user can also access the XML files
               enable us to observe and further discuss the encoding design. In terms of conceptual
               design, the encoding follows the definitions of fundamental notions such as
               'document', 'text', 'version', and 'work' as discussed by Peter Shillingsburg in his
               book <emph>Scholarly Editing in the Computer Age</emph> (1996). As the project
               continues to evolve, its encoding model documents and contributes also to the
               evolution of the Guidelines on the representation of manuscript sources and genetic
               editing. The first research module published in 2011 is based on TEI P5 version 1.0.0
               and expands the DTD (Document Type Definition) with tags from a working document of a
               Workgroup on Genetic Editions of the TEI Special Interest Group "Manuscripts". Given
               that a number of recommendations made by this workgroup have been incorporated into
               TEI P5 version 2.0.0 (December 2011) and successively into the TEI P5 version 2.3.0
               (January 2013), the BDMP also follows the TEI Guidelines’ evolution on this. </p>
            <p xml:id="p17">Each document is deeply marked up in terms of metadata, main structural
               tags, global attributes and authorial alterations (additions, deletions,
               transpositions, metamarks and related attributes). In addition, for some tags, an
               @xml:id attribute is used to refer to a single, specific element, in order to deal
               with the BDMP's cross-document functionalities. Editorial comments are encoded using
               the <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> element. From the point of view of genetic criticism,
               it clearly emerges that the main encoding goal is to document and represent the
               complex and multidimensional genetic relations that occur in the course of the
               writing process at the (microgenetic) level of the document (writing tools, revisions
               or writing campaigns) as well as at the (macrogenetic) level of the dossier
               (versions, paralipomena). What defines these textual units, while also generating
               genetic relations among them, is that they occur in different chronological phases of
               writing. This is the rationale embedded in the BDMP’s underlying encoding, which
               tries to combine a text-oriented with a document-oriented approach – a critical
               interpretation of the "chronotoposensitive" qualities of the data.</p>
            <p xml:id="p18">A crucial decision of the encoding of genetic relations is the very
               identification of the units in question – a definition which allows for further
               processing of the data. Specifically, in Beckett’s penultimate work, <emph>Stirrings
                  Still/Soubresauts</emph>, in which the chronology of documents is extremely
               complex, the textual material is encoded using different types of comparable units:
               large (<code>&lt;div&gt;</code> section), medium (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code> paragraph),
               small (<code>&lt;seg&gt;</code> sentence or segment). Each textual unit possesses an
                  <code>@n</code> attribute as a unique identifier consisting of the document’s
               catalogue number and the number of the corresponding sentence/segment in the 'base
               text’ (special encoding care is taken for textual units that eventually did not make
               it into the base text), alongside the <code>@version</code> attribute, which
               indicates the chronological sequence of the versions of a textual unit, and a set of
               other attributes such as <code>time</code>, <code>chrono</code>,
                  <code>xml:lang</code>, and <code>trans</code>/<code>orig</code> (e.g <code>&lt;seg
                  n="MS-UoR-2934,[0127]"&gt;</code>). Since 2011, the BDMP has adopted a more simple
               encoding approach, making use of the smallest unit, the segment
                  <code>&lt;seg&gt;</code>, as the default unit comparable to other versions; the
                  <code>@version</code> and <code>@zone</code> attributes are also used to situate
               each unit in a chronological sequence and within the page surface respectively. </p>
            <p xml:id="p19">What is truly exciting in the encoding of these genetic relations of the
               textual traces is that they can be dynamically compared; it is this very comparison
               that allows us to speak of genetic variants and translation variants at all. However,
               the <emph>a priori</emph> rule of genetic criticism is that there is no absolute
               invariant text that can function as a fixed point of collation against which the
               rewritings/versions can be compared. Moreover, the restrictions of the book format
               cannot deal with the multitude of genetic or translation variants or with the
               representation of their textual context within the traditional concept of a critical
               apparatus. While the notion of ‘variant’ is inherently – both theoretically and
               practically – problematic in genetic criticism, digital editing projects of literary
               drafts have challenged this very concept (see, for example, the "linkemic approach"
               in Vanhoutte 2000). In its turn, the BDMP proposes an innovative system of ‘relative
               calibration’: "if there is no invariant to compare the variants with, it is always
               possible to compare a variant with another variant, on condition that the edition
               indicates which variant serves as a 'temporary invariant' (for instance the previous
               version in the chronology of composition)". This system of relative calibration
               situated in this non-hierarchical textual environment (in the sense that no text is
               more definitive or "authentic" than any other) is based on an encoding which uses a
               numbering system keyed to a so-called 'base text' whereby, for the BDMP, the ‘base
               text’ is the text of the last extant document preceding the <emph>bon à tirer</emph>
               moment.</p>

            <head>Technical infrastructure</head>
            <p xml:id="p20">The BDMP lacks of a clear cut distinction of technical implementation
               and data model description: under the subsection on "Technical documentation", most

               slightly repeating the information found under the ‘Encoding guidelines’/‘BDMP
               Encoding Manual’ (see also the section "Documentation, user engagement and spin-offs"
               of this article). As a result, the project’s documentation is relatively tacit as

            <head>The Beckett Digital Library: reading traces and exogenesis</head>
            <p xml:id="p31">The Beckett Digital Library (BDL), the latest addition to the BDMP,
               while differing from the research modules in its design and rationale, is a welcome
               addition to the project’s scholarly contribution; it functions as a separate module
               and pursues the analysis of an integral part of the genesis of Beckett’s oeuvre. The
               BDL aims to digitally reconstruct Samuel Beckett's personal library <emph>in
                  extenso</emph>, meaning the writer’s actual library (the books Beckett possessed
               throughout the years and which were dispersed during the course of his life and after
               his death) and a virtual one (the books’ entries once used by the writer based on
               allusions on his works/drafts, for which no physical copy has been retrieved) (see
               Ferrer 2010). By identifying the intertextual references found in Beckett’s drafts,
               the BDL attempts to expand the study of Beckett’s writing process in the direction of
               its "exogenesis" – of the traces of his reading and of his interaction with external
               sources during the creative process (Debray Genette 1979) – and to map the complex
               relationship between writing and reading in Beckett’s production.</p>
            <p xml:id="p32">
               <figure xml:id="img7">

                  <head type="legend">The Beckett Digital Library.</head>
               </figure> The module, presumably structured using a relational database format,
               documents 761 extant volumes and 248 virtual entries (with full bibliographic
               metadata descriptions), to offer (wherever available) digital facsimiles of various
               visual aspects of the books (book covers, title pages, pages with marginalia etc.),
               and finally to link the latter to Beckett's manuscripts in BDMP’s modules through
               ‘manuscript links’ in the bibliographic description of the volume’s entry (<ref type="crossref" target="#img7">Fig. 7</ref>). A number of metadata are provided
               for each book entry, including bibliographic data, the ‘inscription’ field (Beckett's
               signature, date of acquisition, dedication etc.), information about whether there are
               ‘reading traces’ in the book, the ‘notes’ referring to Beckett's copy and its
               documentary features and finally a ‘manuscript link’ (if a passage is alluded to in
               the drafts, a link will direct the user to the relevant manuscript).</p>
            <p xml:id="p33">Given the abovementioned information architecture, the design of the BDL
               succeeds to offer multiple and clear navigation paths through the multi-level
               content, while trying to keep a uniform layout with the rest of the project
               (navigation panel, tabs with drop-downs lists, dynamic slide show). The user can
               choose to navigate through the BDL content by using a faceted browsing tool or a
               free-text faceted search function, with the back and home buttons always present in
               the panel; a detailed BDL manual is also available for consultation in the navigation
               bar.</p>
         </div>
         <div xml:id="div8">
            <head>Site interface, navigation and searching</head>
            <p xml:id="p34">The BDMP’s interface design succeeds in ordering a vast amount of
               primary and critical material while maintaining its simplicity and clarity at no cost
               to the design’s functionality and without appearing overwhelming or complicated to
               the user. The key to this is, in my view, the consistency and minimal use of
               graphical navigation controls throughout the site.</p>
            <p xml:id="p35">The main site navigation, located on the upper horizontal bar, contains
               the different tabs, which, through one-deep drop-down menus, allow the user to
               recognize and enter the clearly defined components of the project (About, Genetic
               Editions, Documentation, Free Features). A similar interface design is used across
               the navigation of the research modules’ features, with minor differences in the BDL
               and a few customizations in tabs according to each module’s genetic dossier. As for
               the presentation of the drafts and their transcriptions, great effort has been made
               to keep the graphical user interface elements (thumbnails, pop-up notes, mouseover
               magnify control, mouseover alternate text, modal and utility windows) to a minimum
               and to keep to an aesthetic awareness with regards to the overall layout of the
               transcription conventions. In addition, both in the text and in the image view, an
               arrow-based navigation, placed near the numbering of the manuscript, helps the user
               to navigate through the <emph>dossier génétique</emph>.</p>
            <p xml:id="p36">All in all, the front-end navigation adequately reflects the back-end
               content architecture alongside a clear, minimal, functional and uniform design that
               succeeds in delivering a smooth user experience. This ensures that users understand
               where everything is and how to accomplish a task. Given the purely scholarly
               orientation of the BDMP, some instances of its design such as the wide content frames
               (fixed width of the body class at 1000px) and some colour choices, prove that an
               adaption to handheld devices (smart phones, iPad and other tablets) is not a priority
               for the project at the moment.</p>
            <p xml:id="p37">The search function is available as a cross-module feature (excluding
               BDL) and offers, using the Elasticsearch framework, full-text searches of all the
               transcriptions by providing the option of further refining the contextualized results
               by module. While the research value of the word search within the doodles is
               questionable (the results mainly concern the editorial note of the – typically
               figural – doodle), the tool is very useful for ‘suggested searches’ (‘intertextual
               references', 'doodles', 'metamarks' or 'transpositions') specified by element. What
               would be even more useful is to extend the search function for data contained outside
               the transcriptions, such as editorial notes or metadata (e.g. dates, holding
               library).</p>

         <div xml:id="div9">
            <head>Documentation, user engagement and spin-offs</head>
            <p xml:id="p38">Among the things that distinguish the BDMP in the digital editing
               landscape is its methodological persistence and thoroughness in documentation. The
               project dedicates a special section in the main navigation to present its
               documentation portfolio: from editorial guidelines and decisions, detailed navigation
               manuals for each of the research modules and the BDL, to technical and encoding
               documentation, the project achieves a remarkable degree of transparency. As the
               project evolves, its creators are well aware that they not only have to adapt to new
               computational advances (as last spring's interface redesign shows) but also to refine
               their methodological decisions with regards to the digital genetic editing of
               different works, while trying to preserve a consistent approach throughout the
               series. Though the user can easily refer to previous and updated versions of parts of
               the documentation from the main navigation panel (there are three versions of the
               document ‘Editorial Principles and Practice’ from 2011, 2013 and 2015 and specific
               updates for parts of ‘Technical documentation’ available to date), I think it would
               be valuable to provide a related technical documentation reference within each module
               as well as a more dynamic comparison of the evolution of documentation (especially on
               encoding) over the course of the project.</p>
            <p xml:id="p39">There are a couple of comments that could be made regarding the
               project’s evolvement and its continuous scholarly use and value in the long-term.
               Firstly, a clear citation mechanism is offered for all three research modules
               alongside a persistent identifier in form of URLs (except for the BDL). However, the
               anxiety of referenciability not only for different digital representations of
               physical objects (facsimiles, transcriptions) but also for different renderings of
               these representations, e.g. a specific comparison of segments of transcriptions,
               still remains.</p>
            <p xml:id="p40">The BDMP’s updates can also develop in dialogue with users and
               researchers through the ‘Your Comments’ space found at the navigation bar of the
               research modules, where users can give feedback, suggest an alternative reading or a
               comment to any of the documents. By adopting an
               open-to-comments-and-contributions-policy, the BDMP succeeds in involving – in a
               controlled but legitimate way, with the <code>&lt;change&gt;</code> in the
                  <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> – the audience in the editing process and to highlight
               the interpretative nature of editing and transcribing.</p>

               </figure> As part of the evolving character of the project, the creation of spin-off
               products is a clever aspect of resource management and outreach. The BDMP Encoding
                  Manual<note xml:id="ftn3">
                  <ref target="http://uahost.uantwerpen.be/bdmp/">http://uahost.uantwerpen.be/bdmp/</ref>. </note> (<ref type="crossref" target="#img8">Fig. 8</ref>), currently hosted on an external WordPress site on
               the University of Antwerp server, functions as a point of reference and tutorial for
               the most up-to-date version of the BDMP’s TEI encoding strategy both for the
               project’s collaborators and for general users; moreover, it offers a valuable and
               accessible resource for other researchers working on different digital genetic
               editing projects with similar goals and issues. The resource not only invites users
               to investigate the inner workings and infrastructure of the BDMP; it also encourages
               them to actively collaborate with and contact its architects through a blog and a
               private forum appended to the website. From a broader user design perspective, the
               BDMP Encoding Manual ‘escapes’ the uniform layout and architecture of the BDMP’s main
               documentation portfolio. However, the different web environment coupled with the
               inconsistent relevant tab name which redirects from the BDMP website (‘Encoding
               guidelines’) might cause some point of confusion to the user. Finally, the relation
               between parts of the ‘BDMP Encoding Manual’ and the ‘Technical Documentation’ might
               be worth exploring in order to avoid fragmentation or duplication.</p>
            <p xml:id="p42">Within this contributory and collaborative ethos of the BDMP one could
               also notice the development of the Lexicon of Scholarly Editing,<note xml:id="ftn4">
                  <ref target="http://uahost.uantwerpen.be/lse/">http://uahost.uantwerpen.be/lse/</ref>. </note> a joint initiative of the
               European Society for Textual Scholarship (ESTS) and the Centre for Manuscript
               Genetics, initiated within the same ERC grant as the BDMP, that aims to act as an
               international and interdisciplinary forum for the theory and practice of European
               textual scholarship while also building a multilingual lexicon of scholarly editing.
               The Lexicon is not integrally or explicitly related to the BDMP but is initiated and
               actively supported by the BDMP team and community.</p>

            <head>Publication model, copyright and sustainability</head>
            <p xml:id="p44">The corpus of Beckett’s manuscripts remains under the copyright of the
               Estate of Samuel Beckett (a detailed copyright disclaimer is also present in the
               lower part of each screen together with a minimal version of the terms and
               conditions). Given the Estate holders’ requirement that a subscription system must be
               applied in order to retain copyright control over the original documents, the project
               relies on individual and institutional subscribers. A small number of free demos with
               limited functionalities are provided as teasers.</p>
            <p xml:id="p45">As the BDMP’s intention is to evolve in a modular way, it also puts in
               place an interesting development plan and a hybrid dual publication model. The
               project is conceived as a work-in-progress and the initial plan describes 26 research
               modules of an equivalent number of Beckett’s works (individual texts or, in the case
               of shorter texts, a group of texts) in the digital archive (a minimum of one research
               module available for every twelve months) together with a series of 26 ancillary
               printed volumes.</p>
            <p xml:id="p46">From a business/operational viewpoint, this commitment to producing both
               digital and print outputs in a fixed-frequency publication plan, ensures a constant
               level of interest in the project as well as introduces – in a rather modest way –
               publishers into the digital editing arena. Furthermore, this strategy further
               enriches the project partnerships’ list with a number of publishing houses
               undertaking the marketing, sales and distribution procedures of print outputs as well
               as the subscriptions’ management for digital editions: University Press of Antwerp
               &amp; Bloomsbury Publications are distributing since the second volume, Cambridge
               University Press distributes the Samuel Beckett's Library and University Press of
               Antwerp manages the subscription system. The hybrid nature of the publishing model is
               also worth-mentioning: the print output further elaborates in a narrative way a set
               of research questions on the work in question and functions in a complementary way
               (also presented in a dynamic slideshow in the BDMP homepage) without reproducing the
               digital edition.</p>
            <p xml:id="p47">From a more critical point of view, the BDMP’s plans for a print
               scholarly output alongside the digital component, especially while the digital
               resource is under subscription, risks being interpreted as evidence of an ambivalence
               with regards to the role of digital publication as a robust, valuable and prestigious
               output for the reward system in our contemporary scholarly industry. According to
               Pierazzo, this could be partially explained by the need to provide a print book as a
               "material support, a ‘regulatory authority’ (Deegan and Sutherland, 2009, 72) to the
               instability of the digital edition" (Pierazzo 2015, 142) without removing from the
               latter its potential innovativeness. In addition, this hybrid publication model
               resists a kind of spivakian ‘strategic essentialism’, often embedded in digital
               editing, by arguing that the digital edition does not stand as an end-in-itself but
               rather enriches, further supports and enables our scholarly arguments.</p>
            <p xml:id="p48">As regards the financial sustainability plan of the project, it is not
               clear whether the subscription system in place is geared to function as a revenue
               stream that supports the continuation of the project or whether there is some other
               funding option available. In addition, it would be interesting to learn whether and
               under which conditions ERC funded results are part of such a business model.</p>
            <p xml:id="p49">Bearing in mind the BDMP’s position within the field of Beckett and
               Modernist studies, together with its valuable contribution to various methodological
               and technical aspects of genetic digital editing, multiple claims can be raised
               regarding the extent to which the paywall prevents the scholarly community from
               benefiting from such a precious resource. If we want to support a full and fair Open
               Access ethos in digital editing and in our scholarship, we should experiment with and
               challenge a number of economic models (e.g. customized print-on-demand or add-on
               services, merchandising etc.) that will open up our scholarly outputs for access and
               (re)use, thus ensuring the continuous value and impact of our scholarship. Finally,
               it is not clear whether the project employs a robust plan for technical
               sustainability and preservation of the data.</p>

            <head>Concluding remarks</head>
            <p xml:id="p50">To conclude, the BDMP is undoubtedly a rich, scholarly reliable and
               technically sophisticated digital scholarly edition. As I have attempted to argue
               throughout this review, it is – among other things – the intellectual rigor, the firm
               critical orientation based in the school of genetic criticism, the systematic,
               flexible and innovative data modelling and architecture as well as the clear design
               framework that assist the user in exploring the textual genesis (on exogenetic and
               endogenetic levels) of Beckett’s writing, as found in his literary drafts. The BDMP
               challenges and at the same time establishes the standards for what the digital
               scholarly agenda of genetic criticism and of manuscript representation should be and
               how these should be achieved.</p>
            <p xml:id="p51">More importantly, the BDMP offers a groundbreaking reconceptualisation
               of scholarly editing in the "digital paradigm", as argued for by Sahle (2016, 27). By
               using the digital genetic editing of Beckett’s literary drafts as an exemplary case
               study, the BDMP illustrates how we can move from an era of "editorial agnosticism" –
               according to which an ideal edition would be a collection of unedited witnesses
               framed within an interface that would support readerly exploration – to an "age of
               media consciousness" in scholarly editing (Fraistat and Flanders 2013, 12). By thus
               raising awareness of the (digital) medium as a methodological question in scholarly
               editing, the BDMP succeeds not only in offering us a set of processes and tools with
               which to pursue in-depth genetic analysis of Beckett’s oeuvre but also a means
               through which to recognize the goals, related methods and envisioned outcomes of
               genetic criticism afresh: to reconceptualize the notions of ‘variance’, of ‘text’, of
               ‘genesis’, of ‘representation’, of ‘criticism’ in general and in particular for
               Beckett studies. Given this, I think that the BDMP succeeds in modelling and – at the
               same time – fulfilling Gabler’s definition of scholarly editing in the digital
               paradigm: the digital scholarly edition "in its composite complexity [...] as a whole
               is both the product and the facilitator of scholarship and criticism. It is an
               instrument to organize knowledge [and] it enables analysis and generates knowledge in
               continuity, too, from the multiple of discourses that in total it organizes" (Gabler
               2010, 51).</p>
