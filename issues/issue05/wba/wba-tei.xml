         <div type="abstract">
            <p>The William Blake Archive (WBA) attempts to remediate digitally William Blake’s
                    entire corpus of poetic and artistic artifacts. The resulting website exhibits
                    high-fidelity images of his surviving prints, plates, drawings, and canvases
                    that would otherwise remain isolated in difficult-to-access collections around
                    the world. Using an editorial strategy that focuses on the physical object, the
                    WBA successfully individuates physical copies of Blake’s work by supplementing
                    each digital facsimile with unique bibliographic information, editorial
                    commentary, and viewing tools that help users investigate the object’s unique
                    material nature. Functionally, the site would greatly benefit from updates to
                    its user interface and key applet (the Virtual Light Box). The project succeeds
                    as a scholarly digital edition by providing curated and contextualized access to
                    Blake’s literary and artistic output, implementing its core editorial strategy
                    since the archive was launched twenty years ago, in 1996. This review examines
                    the WBA as it existed until 12 December 2016, when the site underwent a major
                    overhaul.</p>
         </div>

      <body>
         <p xml:id="p1">
            <hi rend="bold">Note</hi>. The content of this review is based on our examination of
                and interactions with the WBA, as conducted between May and December, 2016. This
                review was in press when a new version of the WBA was released on 12 December 2016;
                prior to this release, the website provided no indication that a website redesign
                was imminent. As our review pertains to a legacy Digital Humanities project that had
                been in use for twenty years at the time of our review, the authors of this review
                and the editors of this journal believe it is useful to publish this review in its
                current form, even though many of the site’s features and functions discussed below
                have been altered by the new release. The authors followed RIDE’s guidelines and
                archived several pages of the site, and also took screen shots (displayed throughout
                the review), so that the reader of this review can view various pages of the WBA in
                its former incarnation.</p>
         <p xml:id="p2">The editors of the new WBA have described the update as ‘a complete and
                transformative redesign of its website.’ Given that not only the look and feel of
                the digital archive has changed, but also its functionality, a thorough
                reinvestigation of the site is required. It is anticipated that many of the issues
                of functionality we raise in this review will have been addressed by this redesign.
                The authors of the current review look forward to undertaking a full examination of
                the new WBA in the coming months and publishing a supplementary review in the next
                issue. We also plan to address the more conceptual issues that this series of events
                raises — the shifting and impermanent nature of a digital edition’s web interface
                over time.</p>

            <head>Introduction</head>
            <p xml:id="p3">William Blake (1757-1827) was an English poet, painter, and
                    printmaker, who frequently combined mediums to produce some of the most
                    innovative work of the Romantic period. He is responsible for the invention of
                    relief-etching (a reversal of the intaglio method), which he used to create a
                    series of what he termed ‘illuminated books,’ containing prints that blur the
                    boundaries between text and art. Surviving copies of these original prints are
                    housed in a variety of public and private collections around the globe, with
                    varying but typically limited levels of accessibility (in part to protect and
                    conserve the originals). While some of these artifacts have been republished for
                    public consumption over the years, either in print anthologies or digital
                    exhibits, The William Blake Archive (WBA) represents the first concerted effort
                    by a group of scholars to curate, annotate, and publish as many copies of
                    William Blake’s works as possible into a materially-focused scholarly digital
                    edition (SDE).</p>
            <p xml:id="p4">WBA’s endeavor is important because individual copies of Blake’s
                    works, particularly the illuminated books, are often drastically and
                    intentionally visually distinct from one another. On the plates he prepared for
                    his illuminated books, Blake inscribed designs that intermingle his handwritten
                    poems with his illustrations. The plates were printed at various times,
                    producing differences in inking and impression, and once printed, Blake added to
                    the prints with ink and water color designs. By liberally experimenting with
                    color choice and other elements from copy to copy, Blake transformed each
                    physical page into a uniquely original artifact that he would bind with others
                    to make up his illuminated books. Blake also had a tendency to rearrange the
                    order in which the poems appeared in his reprinting of these books, thus further
                    problematizing future editorial efforts to publish definitive editions of his
                    work. Blake also worked in other media — painting, engraving, and watercolour —
                    and the ability to understand both individual works and the relations between
                    them has presented an ongoing challenge for Blake scholars.</p>
            <p xml:id="p5">The digital paradigm has relieved pressure to provide a definitive
                    edition of the illuminated books and has made it possible, at least
                    theoretically, to present digital surrogates of all surviving copies of all
                    Blake’s diverse creations. The William Blake Archive embraced this opportunity
                    in the mid-1990s, and produced the following three outcomes: <list rend="ordered">
                  <item>An archive of William Blake’s works, composed of high-fidelity digital
                            facsimiles of the physical objects that comprise his output as a poet
                            and visual artist (e.g. pages, plates and canvases). Each object is
                            attached to a wealth of scholarly information specific to its indexical
                            level and can be observed in isolation or in juxtaposition with related
                            objects.</item>
                  <item>A body of detailed supplementary material providing the historical and
                            technical context for William Blake and his works, as written by the
                            editors and expert contributors.</item>
                  <item>A carefully curated list of resources for further research, including
                            a series of annually updated bibliographies organized by topic and an
                            open archive of <emph>Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</emph> — a
                            University of Rochester journal in operation since 1967 as the
                                <emph>Blake Newsletter</emph>.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p xml:id="p6">Although it calls itself an archive, the WBA satisfies our developing
                    definition of a SDE insofar as it collects many different electronic editions of
                    Blake’s literary and artistic output. It explains in detail its protocols and
                    rationale for reproducing, curating, annotating, and transcribing the digital
                    facsimiles of Blake’s plates, pages, and works of art. According to the editors,
                    the WBA has sought from its inception to adapt the scholarly rigour of a print
                    edition to the digital environment. ‘It makes sense to see the Blake project as
                    an extension of ongoing archival, cataloguing, and editorial enterprises into a
                    new medium in order to exploit its radical advantages,’ explains the WBA’s <ref target="http://web.archive.org/web/20160628065224/http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/public/about/principles/index.html">Editorial Principles</ref>. One of the first digital scholarly editions,
                    the William Blake Archive’s existence is coeval with the development of the web
                    itself. In 2003, it won the Modern Language Association's Prize for a
                    Distinguished Scholarly Edition, and in 2005 it received the seal of approval of
                    the MLA's Committee on Scholarly Editions. The WBA was the first digital edition
                    to be awarded these honors (Jones 2006).</p>
            <p xml:id="p7">Patrick Sahle has recently provided a pragmatic and, we believe,
                    useful definition for a ‘scholarly edition’ (SE) and a ‘scholarly digital
                    edition’ (SDE): the former, he describes as ‘<emph>the critical representation
                        of historic documents</emph>,’ and the latter as ‘<emph>guided by a digital
                        paradigm in [its] theory, method and practice</emph>’ (Sahle 2016, 28).
                    Sahle’s use of the term ‘digital paradigm’ reflects the understanding that what
                    an edition is and does has been transformed by its digital representation. SDEs,
                    says Sahle, ‘offer the opportunity to overcome the limitations of print
                    technology. The new possibilities have a fundamental impact on the theory and
                    methodology of critical editing in general’ (20). What we want and may be able
                    to do within digital media may change our very approach to editing, thus forcing
                    us to rethink entirely the goals and outcomes of textual scholarship.</p>
            <p xml:id="p8">Thus, the WBA terms itself an archive with a set of ‘editorial
                    principles,’ and its three editors state that ‘we want the Archive to be much
                    more than an edition’ (WBA, <ref target="http://web.archive.org/web/20160628065224/http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/public/about/principles/index.html">Editorial Principles</ref>). As Sahle suggests in his discussion, projects
                    like the WBA challenge the very concept of an edition: ‘If we take the critical
                    engagement and the application of scholarly knowledge as the defining
                    characteristics of an edition, then we can say that from a certain point on, an
                    archive starts to be an edition’ (34). We believe that the WBA has successfully
                    undergone this metamorphosis from archive to edition (and indeed to something
                    more than both), by critically engaging with and applying scholarly
                    knowledge.</p>

            <head>Brief history of the project</head>
            <p xml:id="p9">The WBA is one of the earliest experiments in the digital humanities,
                    having begun over two decades ago and existing in a state of constant
                    development since then. The Archive was conceived by three Blake scholars,
                    Morris Eaves (University of Rochester), Robert Essick (University of California,
                    Riverside), and Joseph Viscomi (University of North Carolina), who were then
                    working together on a pair of volumes for the William Blake Trust’s facsimile
                    editions of the illuminated books. They arrived at the idea of a digital edition
                    for Blake after experiencing frustration with the physical constraints of the
                    print medium, which posed inevitable limits on their ability to represent fully
                    and faithfully the changeable nature of Blake’s productions. The print editions
                    prepared by Eaves, Essick, and Viscomi could only present one copy of each
                    illuminated book — thus implicitly canonizing one version/copy over the rest. On
                    a digital platform, these editors realized, the shades of nuance and variety in
                    Blake’s oeuvre had the potential to be more wholly preserved and presented.</p>
            <p xml:id="p10">In 1994, the trio applied to become Associated Networked Fellows at
                    the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH). Here they drew
                    up a proposal for a digital William Blake Archive in <ref target="http://web.archive.org/web/20160317013219/http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/public/about/plan/index.html">three major phases</ref>: First, they would attempt to photograph and
                    digitally publish multiple copies of each of Blake’s illuminated books. Second,
                    they would expand their procedure to other categories of his work (e.g. to his
                    individual prints, paintings, drawings, and manuscripts). And third, they would
                    add interpretive supplementary material, explore secondary publication options,
                    and investigate educational applications for the project. The exact structure
                    and timeline of this plan would evolve in the years to come, but the original
                    proposal still represents a fair outline of the trio’s intent and approach to
                    setting a William Blake SDE in motion.</p>
            <p xml:id="p11">During Phase 1 the co-editors commenced the project with a focus on
                    Blake’s illuminated books. The illuminated books were the first category
                    selected for inclusion for the following reasons:<list rend="bulleted">
                  <item>Their historical and artistic value;</item>
                  <item>The editorial and technical challenges they present;</item>
                  <item>Their relative coherence as an extensive group;</item>
                  <item>The difficulties their fragility and wide dispersion have created for
                            scholars;</item>
                  <item>And the need for a new map of their place in Blake's lifetime of
                            artistic labor (WBA, <ref target="http://web.archive.org/web/20160628065224/http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/public/about/principles/index.html">Editorial Principles, see ‘Principles of Inclusion’)</ref>.</item>
               </list>The editors described their initial acquisition of multiple copies of
                    Blake’s illuminated books as ‘a kind of archival and editorial backbone for the
                    project’ (WBA, Editorial Principles).</p>
            <p xml:id="p12">The team began by determining the optimum photographic format,
                    scanning resolution, and file size for their archive-type while simultaneously
                    compiling a prioritized list of Blake’s books and seeking cooperation from the
                    collections these were housed in. By the end of the first year, the project had
                    agreements with four contributors: The Library of Congress, the Huntington
                    Library and Art Galleries, Glasgow University Library in Scotland, and the
                    Essick Collection. The editors supervised an initial six-day photography session
                    at the Library of Congress that yielded the archive’s first 620 images. Eaves
                    and Essick shared the responsibility for generating bibliographical information
                    and image descriptions, while Viscomi produced most of the final digital images
                    and transcriptions of Blake’s texts. The editors launched the first web version
                    of the William Blake Archive in 1996 with two copies each of Blake’s <emph>Book
                        of Thel</emph> and <emph>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</emph>.</p>
            <p xml:id="p13">In 1996, new hardware, software, and technical support enabled the
                    team to develop an image-based search system, to add a list of reference works,
                    and to incorporate the Inote tool (a Java-based applet that allowed them to
                    attach region-specific annotations to their images). Many more copies of Blake’s
                    twenty illuminated books were added, and new sections of the site debuted to
                    improve transparency of the project and showcase its aims and objectives,
                    editorial principles, technical summary, and future plans. These sections made
                    public the degree of scholarly rigor to which the project holds itself
                    accountable, demonstrating how the WBA not only archives images of Blake’s
                    works, but also critically represents these images by adjoining information
                    deemed important to understanding them in their physical and historical
                    contexts.</p>
            <p xml:id="p14">In 2000, the team was able to enter Phase 2 by uploading additional
                    categories of Blake’s work: <cit>
                  <quote>By expanding outward from the core of the illuminated books
                            (typically watercolor relief etchings) to the other works designed and
                            engraved by him, and then to those designed by him but engraved by
                            others, and finally to those designed by others but engraved by him, we
                            aim to maintain coherence while gradually achieving the desired
                            scope.</quote>
                  <bibl>WBA, Editorial Principles </bibl>
               </cit>
            </p>
            <p xml:id="p15">An inspection of the Archive’s Updates section reveals that the
                    editors have by and large successfully followed this curation strategy over the
                    years — fleshing out the categories of Blake’s work from the illuminated books
                    outwards, and contextualizing each new addition as it occurs in their Updates
                    section. They thus developed a content model than has been able to ‘facilitat[e]
                    productive growth’ (Reed 2014, para. 19).</p>
            <p xml:id="p16">By the end of 2003, the WBA had expanded to include a full range of
                    drawings, paintings, and prints from an expanding circle of nineteen
                    international collections. One of the benefits of the Archive became that it now
                    allowed researchers to observe the intersections between Blake’s illuminated
                    books and his other artistic and commercial ventures (Eaves 1999, 139). Entering
                    Phase 3 in 2004, the number of contributing collections and digital images
                    continued to rise, and the site’s textual content underwent a conversion from
                    its original SGML encoding to an XML format that would preserve usability moving
                    forward.</p>
            <p xml:id="p17">The WBA then moved its base of operation to the Carolina Digital
                    Library and Archives at the University of North Carolina (UNC), which provided
                    the resources to address its technical and editorial challenges simultaneously.
                    A new manuscript team updated many documents by incorporating an XML tagset with
                    additional Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) elements that regularized
                    abbreviations and unconventional spellings, ensuring that archived objects are
                    now fully searchable by their transcribed content. The incorporation of a
                        <emph>Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</emph> archive was also initiated
                    during this phase in order to flesh out the SDE with a ‘fusion of
                    cross-searchable primary (editorial) and secondary (critical) scholarship,’
                    (WBA, ‘<ref target="http://web.archive.org/web/20160622214744/http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/public/about/plan/index.html">Plan of the Archive</ref>').</p>
            <p xml:id="p18">In 2009, kicking off Phase 4, the WBA added the Related Works
                    system: a set of tools designed to enable users to study the relationships
                    between works and individual objects in the Archive. ‘Lightbox’ replaced Inote
                    as the WBA’s image-annotation app, and gave users the tools to manipulate and
                    compare objects in a single workspace. The rest of Phase 4’s goals include
                    expanding the WBA’s backlog of <emph>Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</emph>
                    issues and the continued addition of specifically queued Blake artifacts to the
                    Archive. The content of the Archive itself has been updated periodically over
                    the past four years and as recently as June 2016. The WBA increasingly has
                    become a standardized source of images and transcriptions for the republication
                    of Blake’s works, to such an extent that it was sourced by W.W Norton &amp;
                    Company for its latest critical edition of Blake’s works (Grant 2008). We
                    present this long history to demonstrate how carefully the project has been
                    staged and grown during its twenty-year existence.</p>
         </div>
         <div xml:id="div3">
            <head>Editorial principles and strategy</head>
            <p xml:id="p19">The WBA’s co-editors are all leading Blake scholars and editors who
                    came to the project after experimenting for years with different editorial modes
                    for presenting the poet-artist in print. The editors cite the arguments
                    developed in several of their books — Essick’s <emph>Separate Plates of William
                        Blake</emph> (1983) and <emph>William Blake’s Commercial Book
                        Illustrations</emph> (1991), Eaves’s <emph>The Counter-Arts Conspiracy: Art
                        and Industry in the Age of Blake</emph> (1992), and Viscomi’s Blake and the
                    Idea of a Book (1993) — as thus having laid the philosophical groundwork for
                    their decision to prioritize the physical object over the abstracted concept of
                    a ‘work’ in their developing SDE.</p>
            <p xml:id="p20">In this way — as Ashley Reed, project manager of the WBA from 2007
                    to 2013, explains — the project structures itself around the concept of
                    ‘Blake-as-craftsman’ (Reed 2014, para. 11). The WBA’s editorial strategy is
                    therefore designed to allow its audience to observe and evaluate the original
                    artistry, arrangement, and contents of Blake’s surviving physical canon, down to
                    minute details and differences between various printings. The expansion of the
                    archive to include engravings, paintings, drawings, and manuscripts has enlarged
                    this understanding of ‘Blake-as-craftsman,’ while remaining committed to
                    editorial and curatorial practices that emphasize Blake’s productive
                    processes.</p>
            <p xml:id="p21">In its representation of historical documents, the WBA resolutely
                    does not offer reading texts beyond the transcriptions of the actual document
                    witnesses. The WBA deliberately departs from the strategy native to the print
                    edition, in which an editor <cit>
                  <quote>must not only extract text from objects that are composites of text
                            and design and convert them to conventional type but also must represent
                            ‘the work’ as a single work — <emph>The [First] Book of Urizen</emph> —
                            rather than as a collection of different visual and textual orders under
                            one title. In such printed editions, differences are relegated to the
                            editorial apparatus.</quote>
                  <bibl>WBA, Editorial Principles </bibl>
               </cit>
            </p>
            <p xml:id="p22">By design and opportunistically, the WBA deviates from strategies in
                    which ‘the edited text is by far the most important feature, the core and the
                    exclusive centre of the edition’ (Sahle 2016, 31). Its aim is instead to allow
                    users to view different copies of Blake’s works, side-by-side, rather than
                    representing an ideal, definitive text. The WBA leverages digital media to
                    accomplish this objective out of a recognition that Blake’s productions were
                    never presented, viewed or understood as single works in his lifetime.</p>

                  </figure> The electronic images that make up the WBA’s fundamental archival
                        units are encoded using a Document Type Definition developed by the Text
                        Encoding Initiative (TEI). All textual information attached to these entries
                        are encoded in XML and stored in a native XML database powered by eXist. A
                        complex set of XSLT stylesheets transforms these XML documents into HTML,
                        delivered via the Apache Cocoon Web development framework.</p>
               <p xml:id="p24">While the WBA’s tagging system and archival structure is
                        demonstrably sound, its front-facing user interface is noticeably dated (its
                        editors acknowledging that a complete overhaul was overdue in 2012). The
                        most problematic element of this outdatedness is its lack of a
                        straightforward, consistent, and comprehensive navigation menu. Navigation
                        tools are usually present in one form or another across the WBA, but their
                        clarity, location, and functionality varies greatly. When used, these
                        navigational tools too often proliferate additional tabs or windows when the
                        user attempts to access a new page, resulting in many open tabs and
                        navigational dead ends. The WBA lacks a drop-down navigation menu and search
                        bar anchored at the top (or side) of the page that occurs across all pages
                        (see <ref type="crossref" target="#img1">Fig. 1</ref>), one of the core
                        design features expected of a modern website. Incorporating one would be a
                        helpful and intuitive solution to the issues mentioned here.</p>

               <head>Archive organization and contents</head>
               <p xml:id="p25">The William Blake Archive currently contains multiple copies of
                        twenty illuminated books, along with multiple copies of sixty other works or
                        groupings of works in genres such as commercial book illustrations, solo
                        prints and prints in series, drawings and paintings, and manuscripts and
                        typographic works. In the main index, works or groups of works are
                        categorized according to medium and arranged chronologically within these
                        sections. One can then access the related bibliographical information and
                        editorial commentary of a work on several levels, depending on the genre.
                        For example, one can observe information relevant to a work on the level of
                        a work, on the level of a specific copy of that work, and on the level of a
                        specific page (or ‘object’) of that copy.</p>
               <p xml:id="p26">At the level of works or groups of works, several paragraphs
                        provide historical and technical context and a list of related works that
                        exist and/or are available within the Archive. At the level of a copy, there
                        are editorial notes if relevant and a chronological list of that copy’s
                        individual page objects.</p>
               <p xml:id="p27">Finally, at the object level (on the Object View Page), a high
                        fidelity digital image of the artifact is presented and annotated with its
                        original dimensions (at which it can be viewed via the Image Enlargement
                        feature). These digital images are produced using three types of source
                        media: 4"x5" transparencies, 8"x10" transparencies, and occasionally 35mm
                        slides. The most recent version of Microtek’s ScanWizard software is used to
                        perform these scans, and as of June 2012 all images have been scaled 1:1.
                        Once scanned, these images are color corrected and verified for accuracy
                        against the original artifact. These measures translate into superb viewing
                        quality for users, especially when one follows the computer
                        spec-recommendations specified under the WBA’s ‘<ref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007170619/http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/help/help.html#hazards">Known Hazards and Most Favorable Conditions of the Archive</ref>’
                        section. The quality control exercised in the presentation of digital
                        images, given the challenges of shifting technology, deserve high praise
                        (see Viscomi 2002, "Digital Facsimiles").</p>

                        features a range of scholarly annotations and interactive tools that help
                        the user assess the object’s material uniqueness and its relationship to
                        other artifacts (see <ref type="crossref" target="#img2">Fig. 2</ref>).
                        These features help demonstrate how the WBA, as a scholarly edition, is
                        conceptually motivated ‘to uncover the cultural treasures of the past and to
                        reconstitute important documents, texts and works in the most reliable way
                        possible’ (Sahle 2016, 19). These editorial features contributing to the
                        reliable reconstitution of Blake’s artifacts, are as follows:<list rend="bulleted">

                     </figure>
                     <item>An option to ‘compare’ the object to its other copies (see <ref type="crossref" target="#img3">Fig. 3</ref>). Different copies
                                of an object can be selected from a list and launched in a new
                                window that displays the user’s current and selected copies along a
                                horizontal scroll bar. This feature’s greatest strength is how it
                                enables the user to look through at all these copies within a single
                                window, but the horizontal presentation used to accomplish this is
                                quite inflexible. The Lightbox applet solves some of this
                                inflexibility, but has its own problems, which we will address
                                later.</item>
                     <item>A textual transcription, as applicable. Diplomatic transcriptions
                                accompany text-containing images to assist the user in navigating
                                the verbal content of the image. The diplomatic transcriptions are
                                conservative transpositions of the text into a conventional type
                                font, retaining Blake’s capitalization, punctuation, spelling, and
                                an approximation of his page layout. The transcriptions do not make
                                use of elaborate or evocative typography or editorial sigla, as
                                these features are rendered unnecessary in the presence of the
                                high-fidelity facsimile. These transcriptions are also used to
                                effectively index Blake’s works within the WBA’s search engine,
                                although the retention of Blake’s (sometimes) idiosyncratic spelling
                                (e.g. ‘tyger’) requires a degree of knowledge on the part of users
                                to search transcriptions effectively.</item>
                     <item>An illustration description, as applicable. In these annotations,
                                the WBA’s editors rigorously describe the literal contents of
                                Blake’s illustrations. The descriptions are meant to address a
                                common problem in Blake scholarship, wherein critical
                                interpretations are made ‘based on weak, partial, or mistaken
                                impressions of what appears in the designs’ and also to reflect
                                differences between copies in matters such as color choice and
                                printing alterations (WBA, <ref target="http://web.archive.org/web/20160628065224/http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/public/about/principles/index.html">Editorial Principles</ref>, see ‘Contextual Information’).
                                Furthermore, each description tags specific ‘components’ of the
                                illustration (e.g. a ‘sun’ or a ‘lion’) using a consistent,
                                indexable vocabulary recognized by WBA’s image search engine. The
                                scholarly rigour of these descriptions and their attachment to all
                                image-bearing objects enables an important and unique scholarly
                                feature of the edition: the ability to search for and instantly
                                collate all objects across Blake’s multi-generic oeuvre that share a
                                specific element of iconography.</item>

                                into an edition. The critical handling of the material is a second
                                necessary condition for an edition. A representation without such
                                treatment or the addition of information is not an edition — but a
                                facsimile, a reproduction or — nowadays — a digital archive or

                        annotation, and meta-data, it makes sense to us that the WBA does not
                        actively solicit contributions from users, but rather has a dedicated staff
                        to maintain, grow, and correct the Archive (the WBA does, however, provide
                        an email to report problems/bugs, and even provides a phone number for
                        ‘particularly urgent or unusual requests’ in their <ref target="http://web.archive.org/web/20160929184442/http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/public/about/faq/index.html">FAQ</ref>). The edition’s academic rigor accounts for its success as a
                        scholarly resource. As the editors note, ‘we must supply reproductions that
                        scholars can depend upon in their research’ (WBA, <ref target="http://web.archive.org/web/20160628065224/http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/public/about/principles/index.html">Editorial Principles</ref>); the rigorous implementation of these
                        standards ensures that their reproductions, transcriptions, and other
                        contextual information can be cited and relied upon by scholars.</p>

                  </cit> This is merely one of the myriad of iconographic combinations users
                        can create. Thus, in combination with WBA’s textual search engine, users can
                        rapidly curate any imaginable combination of artistic and literary motifs
                        that appear in Blake’s works. This feature demonstrates how the digital
                        paradigm can uniquely elevate the critical value and functionality of a

                        Lightbox application is occasionally buggy and the Java plugin required to
                        run the app precludes its use within the Google Chrome browser. Relatedly, a
                        functional gap worthy of exploration may be the Lightbox’s current inability
                        to ‘save’ a carefully curated workspace and allow the user to return to it
                        later.</p>

               <p xml:id="p36">While the WBA features a wide variety of features and an often
                        daunting interface, it goes to admirable measures to address user confusion
                        by providing a comprehensive <ref target="http://web.archive.org/web/20161007170619/http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/help/help.html">Help</ref> section. This section contains a variety of easy to follow
                        tutorials with screenshots that explain how to use the Archive’s many
                        sections and features. There also exists a helpful <ref target="http://web.archive.org/web/20160929184442/http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/public/about/faq/index.html">FAQ</ref>, and a ‘<ref target="http://web.archive.org/web/20160628070132/http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/public/about/tour/index.html">Tour of the Archive</ref>’ — a Java-based tutorial that provides users
                        with an image-annotated walkthrough of the Archive that should take less
                        than 15 minutes to complete.</p>
               <p xml:id="p37">While this documentation is useful, it is slowly becoming
                        outdated as the WBA has incrementally improved its layout and features but
                        does not appear to have updated its documentation for several years. Old
                        interfaces and discontinued features therefore crop up in many of the
                        tutorial screenshots and explanations. Still, these discrepancies are small
                        enough that they do not yet create any significant cause for confusion.</p>

                        using a dropdown menu, but each separate parcel of information is launched
                        individually in separate windows — a mechanism which can quickly lead to
                        screen crowding (see <ref type="crossref" target="#img5">Fig. 5</ref>).</p>

                  </figure>WBA’s architects specify in their <ref target="http://web.archive.org/web/20160628070132/http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/public/about/tour/index.html">Tour of the Archive</ref> that this multi-window setup is ‘a
                        premeditated aspect of [the Archive’s] design’ and that ‘in order to use the
                        Archive to its full potential, you should learn how to manipulate multiple
                        windows on your computer’s desktop, and also how to open new browser windows
                        yourself for making various comparisons and cross-references.’ Such a
                        skillset is indeed frequently required for successful digital research, but
                        that doesn’t mean a SDE should force their users to rely on it when better
                        UI options exist.</p>
               <p xml:id="p40">For example, a framework layout could allow WBA users to open
                        more than one of the above features at a time within individual panels
                        arranged on a single page. Depending on the level of customization made
                        possible, such a framework could also allow users to resize, add, or
                        subtract panels as needed – allowing them to easily prioritize the
                        information most relevant to their studies. A possible software tool that
                        could be used to accomplish this is the <ref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20160413112245/http://v-machine.org/documentation/">Versioning Machine (VM)</ref>, which can be used to construct a display
                        environment that ‘provides for features traditionally found in codex-based
                        critical editions, such as annotation and introductory material’ while also
                        ‘taking advantage of opportunities of electronic publishing, such as
                        providing a frame to compare diplomatic versions of witnesses side by side,
                        allowing for manipulatable images of the witness to be viewed alongside the
                        diplomatic edition, and providing users with an enhanced typology of notes’
                        (Vetter 2016).

                        movable panels). Done well, a similar usage by WBA could incorporate or even
                        replace the WBA’s current digital workspace proxy ‘The Virtual

                        certain the editors and their team have, in their project design, been
                        ‘guided by a digital paradigm.’ Sahle notes that <cit>

               <p xml:id="p42">This description perfectly captures the ambitions of the WBA.
                        Although not all of the tools are fully functional, the objective throughout
                        is to harness digital technology for scholarly ends. It is true that ‘one
                        effect of this change in methodology’ from print to digital editing is that
                        ‘the edited text is relativised and the multiple text is facilitated,’ but
                        we view this not as a loss but as a transformation resulting from the shift
                        from page to screen (Sahle 2016, 31). The WBA, like print editions, enables
                        several scholarly primitives, as described by John Unsworth — those of
                        reading and annotating, but also those of discovery (through searching and
                        browsing), comparing (using the compare feature), and collecting (in the
                        Virtual Lightbox). In this way, the WBA successfully exploits digital media
                        to achieve its scholarly objectives.</p>

            <head>Conclusion</head>
            <p xml:id="p43">The William Blake Archive has succeeded in accomplishing its
                    original goals of digitally consolidating and presenting William Blake’s
                    artistic material output. The WBA presents an intellectually-sound foundation
                    for a scholarly digital edition by presenting its intent, principles, technical
                    parameters, and history on its website, and by continuing to document its
                    ongoing progress for many years.</p>
            <p xml:id="p44">Where room for growth is concerned, many sections of the website
                    warrant informational updates from the past four years or so, and a dramatic
                    revision of the site’s user interface may be required to prevent it from falling
                    behind today’s standards. The option to view an object’s editorial notes and
                    annotations from within the Object View Page (such as in the style of a
                    framework layout), is highly recommended, as well as is further development of
                    the Virtual Lightbox applet, which has the potential to elevate the WBA’s
                    significance as a research tool to new levels of sophistication.</p>
            <p xml:id="p45">Overall, the WBA is an impressive, ground-breaking SDE that has
                    followed a clear-sighted editorial strategy, is citable and transparent, and has
                    maintained a high standard of digital image quality and scholarly contextual
                    information across its many additions and developments. WBA’s rigorous editorial
                    attention to transcription and illustration descriptions, image-inclusive search
                    functionality, and comparative tools such as the Lightbox, serve to highlight
                    both the uniqueness of Blake’s individual artifacts and their relationship to
                    one another. In light of these features, we believe the William Blake Archive
                    must be classified as a scholarly digital edition. Furthermore, no printed
                    collection of Blake’s works could practically present and annotate such a
                    high-volume and high-definition series of facsimiles in as profoundly
                    accessible, comparative, and rearrangeable a format.</p>
