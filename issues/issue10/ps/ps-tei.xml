            <p>The project <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> (2012–2017) was aimed at the
                    collection, edition, and analysis of Spanish and Portuguese private letters from
                    the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to the early 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century. As a
                    result, a digital text collection and edition of the letters is presented on the
                    project website. <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> can be classified both as a
                    scholarly edition and a diachronic linguistic corpus and can be considered
                    pioneer work in combining procedures from textual criticism together with the
                    linguistic preparation of the corpus, serving the needs of both historians and
                    linguists. Valuable basic work has been done in encoding approximately 5,000
                    letters which can be downloaded in different formats on the website. Only an
                    open licence for reuse of the data remains desirable and at times the project
                    could have benefitted from an even more advantageous presentation of the results
                    on the website.</p>

         <p xml:id="p1">In the <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> project, private letters written
                in Spain and Portugal between the 16th and the early 19th century were collected,
                edited, and analyzed. Almost all of the letters were previously unpublished, so a
                digital collection and edition of them was one of the main goals of the project.
                Another priority was the historical and linguistic study of the letters in this
                diachronic corpus. The <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> project was funded with an
                ERC Grant between 2012 and 2017 and was hosted at the faculty of arts and humanities
                of the University of Lisbon.<note xml:id="ftn1">For more information about the

                    therefore on general philological aspects of the text collection and edition as

                    2007 and was aimed at the online edition and study of Portuguese private letters
                    written between 1500 and 1900.<note xml:id="ftn6">A description of this project,

                    The letters of FLY were written in the 20th century, in the context of war,
                    migration, imprisonment, and exile. Both the predecessor projects and
                        <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> were carried out at the Linguistics
                    Department of the University of Lisbon, the latter starting in 2012. While
                    dealing with letters from different periods of time and contexts, and
                    transmitted in different ways, the general goals of the projects CARDS and FLY
                    were the same and also the methodology was shared. The approaches developed in
                    the precursor projects were in principle continued in <emph>P. S. Post
                        Scriptum</emph>, but with a different linguistic and regional scope. In
                        <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph>, the corpus was extended to also include
                    letters from Spain from the Early Modern period. In addition, it was announced
                    that further types of linguistic annotation were to be added.<note xml:id="ftn8">Cf. Gomes et al. 2011.</note> In this review, only the results of the

                        occasionally, where they reveal shifts in the methodology and publication

                            developed, along with the publishing and historical-linguistic study of
                            private letters written in Portugal and Spain along the Early Modern
                            Ages. These documents are almost all unpublished epistolary writings
                            made by authors from different social backgrounds. [...] These textual
                            resources often present an (almost) oral rhetoric, treating everyday
                            issues of past centuries in a register that hasn't been easy to study,
                            apart from brief examples. Not only does the P. S. Project present a
                            wide collection of private letters, but it also makes it available as a
                            scholarly digital edition and as an annotated corpus.</quote>

            <p xml:id="p5">What is highlighted here is the relevance of collecting and
                    publishing historical sources that were previously inaccessible to a wider
                    audience, but also their value for the diachronic study of language registers
                    that are rarely documented otherwise. Especially noteworthy is the double goal
                    set for this digital text collection: it is conceived as a scholarly digital
                    edition, but also as a linguistic corpus. This broad scope is reflected in the
                    conception of <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> as an inherently
                    interdisciplinary project with a team of linguists and historians from Spain and
                    Portugal. The “Credits” page, which lists members of <emph>P. S. Post

                        CARDS project at all. It would be helpful to include a brief explanation of
                        the relationship between the two projects into the website to make it
                        self-contained, because currently this information cannot be found on the
                        credits page, nor anywhere else on the <emph>P. S. </emph>

                    involved: historical and computational linguists, a teaching researcher, members

                    digital scholarly editing, conceptionists, and programmers.<note xml:id="ftn11">“Credits.” CLUL 2014. <ref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20180602160832/http:/ps.clul.ul.pt/index.php?action=ficha">https://web.archive.org/web/20180602160832/http:/ps.clul.ul.pt/index.php?action=ficha</ref>.</note>

            <p xml:id="p6">Because of its double goal, <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> should
                    be reviewed as both a scholarly digital edition and a linguistic corpus. This
                    project is one of many that don’t easily fit into a taxonomy of scholarly
                    digital resources.<note xml:id="ftn12">This review therefore draws on both
                        catalogues of criteria developed by the IDE, the <emph>Criteria for
                            Reviewing Scholarly Digital Editions </emph>(<ref target="http://www.i-d-e.de/publikationen/weitereschriften/criteria-version-1-1/">http://www.i-d-e.de/publikationen/weitereschriften/criteria-version-1-1/</ref>.
                        Accessed June 1, 2018) and the <emph>Criteria for Reviewing Digital Text

                        Accessed June 1, 2018), the latter including criteria for the assessment of
                        linguistic corpora. Because the review is published in an issue on scholarly
                        digital editions, the accompanying factsheet is only about editorial
                        aspects, though. Interestingly, <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> labels
                        itself “A Digital Archive”, avoiding the terms “edition” and “corpus” and
                        placing the focus on the organizational, institutional, and preservational
                        dimension instead of the methodological orientation of the selection and
                        treatment of documents and texts. Similar observations are made for other
                        digital resources in the editorial of RIDE 6. Cf. Henny-Krahmer and Neuber
                        2017.</note> It is very laudable that the letters in <emph>P. S. Post
                        Scriptum</emph> are edited critically in order to lay the foundation for
                    research in various disciplines. The project members themselves reflect their
                    multidisciplinary approach: <cit>
                  <quote>The advantages that the new technologies offer to the humanities
                            cannot be denied, even if there is a lack of creation of digital tools
                            that are useful for different scholarly disciplines. In general, the
                            editions designed for the philologist and the historian are not
                            exploited by the linguist in the same manner that an annotated corpus
                            would be; and vice versa, the linguistic corpora, conceived first and
                            foremost to obtain statistics and word concordances, are resources of

                        <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> aims to provide fundamental research for
                    the digital humanities as a whole and not just to serve the needs of a single
                    discipline. In this review, <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> is thus examined
                    from various perspectives. First, the general structure and contents of the
                    project website are discussed. Following this, the general parameters of
                        <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> as a digital text collection are reviewed:
                    the principles of selection of documents and texts, the organization and
                    accessibility of the materials, available metadata and documentation.
                        <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> is then assessed as a scholarly digital
                    edition on the one hand and as a linguistic corpus on the other. Finally, the
                    long-term prospects of the entire resource are evaluated.</p>

            <head>Website</head>
            <p xml:id="p9">The website of <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> is available in three
                    languages: Portuguese, English – the default, and Spanish. What is translated
                    are the main menu, headings and introductory texts on single pages, and search
                    options, except the XPath options and predefined queries for a syntactic search
                    which are only presented in English. Even the metadata for the letters are
                    partially translated. The metadata categories are available in the three
                    languages. For the metadata values, the language of the letter seems to
                    determine their main language.<note xml:id="ftn15">No documentation was found on
                        this aspect of the resource.In the XML files of the letters only the
                        language of translations is marked but the metadata language is not
                        indicated with a language attribute (@xml:lang). Only the language of
                        translations is marked.</note> The letter written from María de Espinosa to
                    her husband, for example, is in Spanish, so the summary, context information,
                    etc. are also given in Spanish. That the metadata is in different languages may
                    complicate a machine-based reuse of the data. Still, the summary and context
                    information of each letter can be switched to English.<note xml:id="ftn16">Once
                        there, the only way to get back to the original language version is the back
                        button of the browser. It would have been nice to also have a button to
                        switch the metadata language back, but this is just a small
                        inconvenience.</note> In some cases, even the text of the letters themselves
                    is translated. Where this is not the case, a hint is given on how to proceed for
                    automatic translation elsewhere.<note xml:id="ftn17">“If there is no translation
                        for the letter itself, you may copy the text (while using the view
                        'Standardization') and paste it to an automatic translator of your choice.”

                    There seems to be no way to search for translated letters, so they can only be
                    found by chance and it is also not possible to find out how many of them have
                    been translated.<note xml:id="ftn18">See “1756. Carta de José da Costa Martins

                    metadata and text are not directly linked to the main language option of the
                    website, so it is for example possible to have the website in Portuguese and
                    read a letter in English. It is comfortable that the main language can be
                    switched on every subpage of the site and not only from the homepage. All in
                    all, much effort has been put into translations to make the site accessible to
                    readers from Portugal and Spain as well as to an international audience.</p>

               </figure> The structure of the website is straightforward. On the homepage, an
                    introductory text about the project, its goals and the methodologies used, is
                    given (see <ref type="crossref" target="#img2">Fig. 2</ref>). Links to
                    documentation are also placed on the homepage and there is a suggestion for how
                    to cite the whole resource, but there are no citation suggestions for individual
                    subpages. The main menu of the website is placed on the left, is visible on all
                    subpages, and has a single level of entries, making it easy to stay oriented on
                    the website. The first half of the menu entries comprises content-related
                    aspects: “Search”, “Participants” and “Map” are all general access points to the
                    letters, followed by the entry “Tree Search” which constitutes an advanced
                    option. The second half of the menu is devoted to project-related information
                    such as “Credits” and “Related Projects”, and to project outcomes other than the
                    presentation of the letters on the website (“Papers” and “Downloads”). The
                    website seems to have a backend<note xml:id="ftn19">Here, “backend” is

                    option has been designed and how it can be used. Regarding the structure of the
                    website, there are a few subpages that cannot be reached directly from the main
                    menu. These are the letters themselves (discussed further below), a “Word

                    divided into four categories: “Tools”, “Digital Editions and Historical

                    While this is an interesting list, some explanation would have been helpful to
                    know in what way the listed “projects” are related to <emph>P. S. Post
                        Scriptum</emph>. The mentioned tools (TEITOK, eDictor, CorpusSearch) have
                    probably been used in the project. It is likely that the project is a member of
                    the associations listed (AHDig and REDaiep). But why is the <emph>Digital
                        Archive of Letters written by Flemish authors and composers</emph> listed
                    under “Guidelines and tutorials” and in what way is the tutorial “Text
                    Processing with Linux” relevant for users of the <emph>P. S. Post
                        Scriptum</emph> website? Also for the “Digital Editions and Historical
                    Corpora”, the relationship between <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> and these
                    other projects is not clear. The predecessor project FLY is listed, but also for
                    example the Mark Twain Project which has probably inspired the methodology of
                        <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> in terms of a digital scholarly edition of
                    letters. Another project mentioned is <emph>"En el ojo del huracán": Cartas de
                        Ultramar a España, 1823 - Edición digital</emph>. The homepage of that
                    project explains that a cooperation between <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> and
                    TEITOK has been established and that the 65 letters of the edition have a second
                    user interface at the Linguistics Centre of the University of Lisbon.<note xml:id="ftn23">See Stangl n.d. and <emph>Ultramar</emph>. 2014. <ref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20180603144610/http:/cards-fly.clul.ul.pt/teitok/ultramar/">https://web.archive.org/web/20180603144610/http:/cards-fly.clul.ul.pt/teitok/ultramar/</ref>.</note>
                    As can be seen, there are various reasons for projects to appear on the “Related
                    Projects” page and a few subheadings or sentences would have helped to clarify
                    the relationships.</p>

                  <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> can be classified as a primary source
                        collection because it includes descriptions and digital facsimiles of the
                        documents, and as a diachronic corpus because it brings together letters
                        from Spain and Portugal from the 16th up to the 19th century. Unfortunately,
                        there is no information on the website about the overall number of letters
                        included in the archive and of the distribution of the letters over time. On
                        the word distribution page, some statistics are given in numbers of words
                        (by language, gender, and social status). The number of words is almost
                        balanced for letters in Spanish and Portuguese (984,830 and 974,391 words,
                            respectively).<note xml:id="ftn25">Cf. “Word distribution.” CLUL 2014.

                        The linguistic focus of the project is illustrated by the fact that the size
                        is measured in “words” instead of “documents” or “texts”. A way to get to
                        the number of letters is to use the search functions: there are 2,369
                        letters in Portuguese and 2,446 in Spanish which makes a total of 4,815
                        letters. A search by year also reveals that the earliest letter in the
                        collection dates from 1500 and the latest letters from the 1830s. It would
                        have been easy to provide some general numbers on the homepage or another
                        page of the website to provide the user with a first impression about the
                        size and composition of the corpus. Despite the word counts on the word
                        distribution page, no overview of the temporal distribution of letters is
                        given which would be an important information for a diachronic corpus.
                        Interestingly, the homepage of the predecessor project FLY includes exactly
                        this: a detailed overview of the sample in the form of a descriptive text
                        and tables (see <ref type="crossref" target="#img3">Fig. 3</ref>). A similar
                        summary is desirable for <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph>.</p>
               <p xml:id="p14">On the website itself, no information is given about the
                        selection criteria for the letters. More information can be found in some of
                        the publications presenting the project, but this is not ideal, for several
                        reasons. First, a user of the website is forced to go through the list of
                        publications and look for those which are concerned with the presentation of
                        the project as a whole. In the case of <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph>, the
                        project descriptions tend to focus either on the Portuguese or on the
                        Spanish subcorpus, depending on the context of the publication, which makes
                        it harder to get information about the whole collection.<note xml:id="ftn26">These are most probably: Gomes et al. 2012, Marquilhas 2012 (about the

                        is presented online. Also, not all of the publications are Open Access and

                        the opinion of this reviewer the publications are an important form of
                        scholarly output, but they cannot replace background and context information
                        published directly with the digital text collection. If an external
                        publication is used to document central aspects of the digital resource and
                        can be considered up-to-date, this should be indicated on the website. This
                        is done, for example, for the guidelines describing the data model, the
                        editorial and the annotation procedures, which are all linked to from the
                        homepage, but unfortunately not for the criteria of selection and

                  </figure> Following the latest publication about the project (Vaamonde
                        2018), it seems that the primary motivation for the creation of the text
                        collection was the scarcity of sources of documenting spoken language for
                        historical linguistics. Archives of courts were chosen as an excellent
                        opportunity to get access to private correspondence, characterized by an
                        immediate, communicative style and not so much influenced by traditional
                        rhetoric. An overview of the consulted archives in Spain shows that most of
                        the letters could be localized in the National Historical Archive. Vaamonde
                        observes that the localization of letters in the archives is a procedure
                        strongly influenced by chance, as systematic catalogues or even databases
                        are rare. In some cases, the process was initiated with random samples.
                        Regarding the chronological distribution of the letters, the author notes
                        that it was hardest to get letters for the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century
                        (see <ref type="crossref" target="#img4">Fig. 4</ref> for an overview).
                        Comparing these numbers with the search results above, approximately 70 % of
                        the located letters have been edited in <emph>P. S. Post

                        and partly in Portuguese. The data in <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> is
                        modelled in XML-TEI and in the first of the two manuals, the entire TEI
                        model is documented, including the TEI header, transcription and editing
                        conventions, changes to the TEI needed for the linguistic annotation, the
                        relationship of the project’s TEI model to TEI-P5, and the separate TEI
                        model for a bibliographic database containing information about the
                        participants of the letters. In the second manual, it is explained how the
                        texts have been treated further as a preparation for linguistic annotation
                        (e.g. modernization and sentence splitting) and how they have been annotated
                        morpho-syntactically. The transcription and editing conventions as well as
                        the linguistic annotations will be reviewed in the corresponding sections on
                            <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> as a scholarly digital edition and as a
                        linguistic corpus below. Here, the general data model is discussed.</p>
               <p xml:id="p17">The data model of <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> – at least
                        the project internal model – is not a straightforward and plain TEI model
                        for several reasons. As Vaamonde explains, when the project started in 2012,
                        the TEI had not decided to include specific elements for the encoding of
                        correspondence yet.<note xml:id="ftn31">This was finally achieved in 2015
                            with the TEI-P5 release 2.8.0. Cf. Stadler et al. 2016-2017.</note> It
                        was therefore decided to follow the model of another project concerned with
                        the edition of letters, the <emph>Digital Archive of Letters by Flemish
                            Authors and Composers from the 19th &amp; 20th century</emph>
                            (DALF)<note xml:id="ftn32">See <ref target="http://ctb.kantl.be/project/dalf/">http://ctb.kantl.be/project/dalf/</ref>. Accessed June 1,
                            2018.</note>. Because the schema used in the DALF project was based on
                        TEI-P4, <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> inherited an already outdated
                        version of the standard. In a way, this is an ironic twist: the intention
                        was to take up the ongoing development of a dedicated module for the
                        encoding of correspondence and the project ended up with an older version of
                        the chosen XML standard. A good way out of this dilemma was found, though:
                        the decision to offer a TEI-P5 version as an export format and to use the
                        model adopted from DALF as an internal one. The version of the data model
                        conforming to TEI-P5 was influenced by the schema of the CHARTA
                            (<emph>Corpus Hispánico y Americano en la Red: Textos Antiguos</emph>)
                            network.<note xml:id="ftn33">Cf. Vaamonde 2017c: 5f. The website of the
                            CHARTA network is available at <ref target="http://www.redcharta.es/">http://www.redcharta.es/</ref>. Accessed June 1, 2018.</note> It is
                        to be valued positively that the <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> project
                        looked for models elsewhere in order to learn from the experiences made in
                        other projects, but especially in the case of the DALF’s TEI-P4 model, the
                        question arises why its innovations in terms of correspondence description
                        were not integrated directly into an own TEI-P5 model.</p>
               <p xml:id="p18">The elements specific for the encoding of correspondence were
                        not the only necessary customization of the schema. To add linguistic
                        annotations to the texts, the tool TEITOK (<emph>A Tokenized TEI
                            environment</emph>) was used, a web-based platform developed by Maarten
                        Janssen in which both rich textual markup and linguistic annotations can be
                        used in combination in single TEI files.<note xml:id="ftn34">See <ref target="http://www.teitok.org/">http://www.teitok.org/</ref>.
                            Accessed June 1, 2018.</note> The TEI format used by TEITOK includes
                        custom elements for the tokenization and annotation of the text. A third
                        component of the family of data models in <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph>
                        is a TEI-P4 model inherited from the CARDS project and used for biographical
                        information about the letters’ authors and addressees.<note xml:id="ftn35">Cf. Vaamonde 2017c: 83f. and 107-118.</note>
               </p>
               <p xml:id="p19">On the website, each letter can be downloaded in the “Pure TEI
                        P5 XML” export format and in the “TEITOK XML” version based on the internal
                        TEI-P4 schema. In the P5 version, no schema is declared explicitly, so
                        supposedly the encoding follows the TEI_all schema. In the TEITOK version,
                        the internal DTD is linked. No schema file is offered directly on the
                        website and as the XML of the biographic database is not accessible, its
                        schema cannot be reviewed either.</p>
               <p xml:id="p20">All in all, the combination of different schemas and
                        customizations is a bit confusing for someone not familiar with the project.
                        No explanations are given directly on the website. However, the detailed
                        manual helps the user to follow the history of the project and the
                        complexities of the data model are layed out transparently in these
                        guidelines. Access to all the schema files would have been good to
                        facilitate a formal overview of the structure of the data and especially for
                        reuse scenarios to make consistency checks and schema adaptations
                        possible.</p>
               <p xml:id="p21">However, apart from how the information on the data model is
                        presented, the will to follow best practices developed in similar projects,
                        the orientation towards standards like the TEI, the thorough documentation
                        of the data model and the possibility to view the XML of the letters on the
                        website are all highly commendable.</p>

               <p xml:id="p25"> Apparently, the “catRef” elements in the text classification
                        point to the type of category declared in the taxonomy, where the category
                        value is given in the description of the type of category. This seems a bit
                        odd, because a category with the same XML-ID can then have a different
                        category description or value in another letter file (for example, if the
                        type is not “pedición”, but a different pragmatic category. Also, it would
                        be good to have insight into the entire taxonomy.</p>
               <p xml:id="p26">It can furthermore be noticed that some fields are empty (in
                        this example, /location/geo for the destination as well as the category
                        description for “linguisticSource”). It is not clear how many of the
                        metadata fields are empty in the overall collection. In order to know
                        whether empty fields are due to work-in-progress or because a value is not
                        mandatory, the manual has to be consulted as there is no formal schema for
                        the TEI-P5 files available. On the website, no report is given on the state
                        of the XML files.</p>
               <p xml:id="p27">Besides the metadata for the letters, biographic metadata is
                        collected in the separate demographic database. In the edition manual, it is
                        described in detail how the data about correspondence participants is
                        modelled (for example, the role, sex, and age of a person are given, person
                        names, and a description of the events related to a person). In the letters,
                        there are pointers from the senders and addressees to the external
                        biographic data, but this data is not available for insight or download.</p>
               <p xml:id="p28">The metadata in <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> is rich and
                        conforms to the standards set by the TEI. Points of criticism which can be
                        raised are the missing access to some external metadata (the biographic
                        database and the complete taxonomy) and a report on the completeness of the
                        data.</p>

                  </figure> Access to the letters and additional data related to the
                        correspondence is offered in a number of ways on the <emph>P. S. Post
                            Scriptum</emph> website. The biographical data, for example, can be
                        assessed via the “Participants” entry in the main menu. It is organized in
                        tabular format with one row per person (see <ref type="crossref" target="#img5">Fig. 5</ref>). Overall, there are 5,071 rows which can be
                        clicked through in steps of 100 entries. A possibility to sort the data
                        would have been nice, for example by a selected column. As it is, it is not
                        clear if the data is ordered at all and on what principle. By clicking on
                        one of the names, a detailed view of the entry is shown. The only additional
                        information in the detailed view is a link to the letters written by the
                        person, so the biographic data is a possible starting point to get to the
                        letters.</p>

                  </figure> Besides these two possibilities to browse the text collection, the
                        main points of access are the search functions. There are two different
                        searches: the “Corpus Search” (simply named “Search” in the menu) and
                        “Syntactic Trees” (called “Tree Search” in the menu). The corpus search is
                        divided into the sections “Text Search”, “Document Search”, and “Discourse
                        Search”. The tree search is also divided into sections two of which are
                        specific for syntactic searches (both the “XPath Search” and the “Predefined
                        Queries” allow to search for specific syntactic units, e.g. subordinate
                        clauses or clitics) while the third one is a general “Document Search”. The
                        searches specific for the edited text and the syntactic annotation will be
                        discussed below in the section on <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> as a
                        scholarly digital edition and as a linguistic corpus, respectively. The
                        document search is identical in the two search interfaces and is shown in
                            <ref type="crossref" target="#img7">Fig. 7</ref>.</p>
               <p xml:id="p32">The document search allows to look for letters by language,
                        archive, year (or a range of years), letter code, origin, destination, or by
                        a list of thematic keywords (e.g. “Agriculture”, “Masonry”, “Church”). Only
                        one of the keywords can be chosen. Documents can also be searched for with
                        the names of the author or addressee and the social status and gender of the
                        author. A help section with further information about the search options is
                        available. The search is well-documented and easy to use. When the document
                        search is performed, the results are displayed in tabular format. The query
                        is automatically transformed into a <emph>Corpus Query Processor</emph>
                        (CQP) string which is shown together with the search results. The following
                        string, for example, represents a search for letters in Portuguese written
                        by female authors up to the year 1600, yielding 55 results: <figure xml:id="code4">
                     <eg>&lt;text&gt; [] :: match.text_lang = "PT" &amp; int(match.text_year)

                     <head type="legend"/>
                  </figure>
               </p>
               <p xml:id="p33"> Beyond the powerful search functions, more browsing options
                        could have been offered. The only ways to browse the collection are the
                        biographic database and the geographic map, but this archive of letters
                        would have had much more to offer. Full indexes of the letters, for example
                        by identifier, year, place, etc., could have been implemented without much
                        additional effort. The search is especially helpful for someone who already
                        knows what she or he is looking for, but for a user interested in the
                        collection as a whole more browsing options would have been helpful to get
                        an overview of what is there. Examples of scholarly digital editions of
                        letters consistently offering both ways of access are <emph>Letters of

                  </figure> Each letter is presented on an individual page (see <ref type="crossref" target="#img8">Fig. 8</ref> for an example). The
                        metadata is presented at the top of the page, starting with the autor,
                        addressee, and letter summary. The metadata area can be expanded for more
                        detailed information and switched to English if translations are available.
                        The text of the letter is given on the left side with the corresponding
                        facsimile(s) to the right. The default text view is the diplomatic
                        transcription, but there are several alternatives that can be chosen in the
                        corresponding “View option” bar above the letter text: “Edition”, “Variant
                        form”, and “Standardization”. In the edition view, abbreviations are
                        expanded. The variant forms view shows the edited text where deletions, for
                        example, are excluded, but historical variants (e.g. “cousa” for “coisa”)
                        are kept. In the standardized view, the edited text is given in a modernized
                        form. Especially the last view is very helpful for a user interested in the
                        content of the letters without being familiar with the historical
                        conventions of writing and historical orthography. This is also the text
                        version that forms the basis for the linguistic annotation and is essential
                        for that task, because a modernized, established text version without
                        variants is usually expected by automatic taggers. The standardized forms of
                        single words are also shown in small boxes as a mouse-over effect.</p>

                        “Show” bar, abbreviations, variants, and standardized forms can be
                        highlighted, the letter text can be displayed with original line breaks, and
                        the facsimiles can be switched on and off. In the “Tags” bar, the different
                        options serve to activate a tokenized version of the letter, to display the
                        part of speech and lemma of each word as well as additional notes on special
                        linguistic characteristics, for example words with clitic doubling in
                        Portuguese, complex syllables, diphthongs or hiatuses. At the bottom of the
                        page, there is a small legend indicating the colors used to display
                        editorial changes to the text. A “Sentence view” is also offered. In this
                        view, the text is split into sentences and displayed as one sentence per
                        line (see <ref type="crossref" target="#img9">Fig. 9</ref>).</p>
               <p xml:id="p43">There are two download options at the bottom of each letter

                        all of them have the same options. Some letter texts are not accompanied by
                        a facsimile (e.g. PSCR5513), some don’t have the detailed POS, lemma,
                        linguistic notes and sentence view options (e.g. PSCR5285), or the variant
                        and standardization views (both PSCR5513 and PSCR5285, for example). As for
                        other aspects mentioned before, it would have been good to have an overview
                        of the editing status of the letters in the whole collection. Another way to
                        make the state of progress more transparent would have been to include
                        search options allowing to look for finalized letters.</p>
               <p xml:id="p45">Although most of the functions are self-evident, a help text
                        explaining the meaning of the different text views, for example, would have
                        been helpful. If the view options are not documented exhaustively on the
                        website, a user might miss them if she or he by accident only views letters
                        where a few of them are available. It was not clear to the reviewer how to
                        find a letter where all options are available, if not by chance.</p>
               <p xml:id="p46">Of all the information encoded in the TEI files, the discursive
                        parts of the letters seem to be the only aspect that is not presented. Apart
                        from that, all the different levels of encoding can be assessed via the web
                        interface in a user-friendly manner. In addition, the “Text Search” supports
                        looking for words on the different levels of transcription (provisional
                        transcription, expanded abbreviations, and standardization). Even if the
                        parts of discourse are not taken up into the HTML view, they can still be
                        searched for with the “Discourse Search” which allows to look for letters
                        containing different types of sentences (opener, closer, harangue,
                        peroration, narration, etc.) and for letter types (friendship, love, family,
                        private business and anonymous letters).<note xml:id="ftn46">See <ref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20180607152620/http:/ps.clul.ul.pt/index.php?action=cqp&amp;act=advanced">https://web.archive.org/web/20180607152620/http:/ps.clul.ul.pt/index.php?action=cqp&amp;act=advanced</ref>.</note>

                        “tok” element. In the “nform” attribute, a normalized version of the token
                        is given. The other attributes serve to hold the lemma, dialectal variants,
                        and so on.<note xml:id="ftn52">See Vaamonde and Magro 2018 for details about

                        letter combining digital edition and corpus is the token or word to which
                        linguistic information is directly added. But the model is also able to keep
                        specific markup from the historical-philological edition. If there is any
                        markup inside a token such as a line break, for example, it is kept. In the
                        case of a span of underlined words, the element to encode the highlighting
                        surrounds several token elements.</p>
               <p xml:id="p50">From the point of view of this reviewer, it is not just a
                        technical question whether different layers of annotation are kept inside a
                        single file or modelled as stand-off markup. Of course a stand-off setup is
                        more difficult to process because units like sentences or words have to be
                        realigned when several layers of annotation are analyzed or presented
                        together. But to find a way to directly integrate both editorial markup and
                        linguistic annotations also contributes to build a rich resource which can
                        be archived in its integrity. In this scenario, the linguistic annotations
                        become part of the edition and are not just another layer which can be added
                        repeatedly in an ad-hoc way, especially if their quality is checked
                        manually. This is not to say that there aren’t any arguments for stand-off
                        markup, but that the editorial decision on the way to model annotations
                        contributes to define the type of resource that is created, in this case a
                        critically edited linguistic corpus.</p>

                        about 25% of each balanced corpus (a corpus of one letter per author in
                        Portuguese and Spanish, respectively) has been annotated syntactically. For

                        completed. The results of the morphosyntactic annotation are directly
                        incorporated into the XML encoding, as can be seen in the above example,
                        whereas the output formats of the syntactic annotation procedure are in
                        principle text-based. They were converted to the XML-based format PSDX (an
                        XML variant of the Penn Treebank format) and then aligned with the main
                        edition file containing the philological and linguistic information by
                        sentence and token, meaning that the syntactic annotation is kept

                        can the different transcription layers of the edition be searched but also
                        word classes, lemmas, POS tags, and linguistic notes. Search queries can
                        also directly be formulated in the corpus query language CQP.</p>

                        charts are not essential for their information value, because they all
                        present the same counts. A welcome feature is the possibility to download
                        all the search results in text-based formats for future use.</p>

                  </figure> For the syntactic annotations, there is a dedicated search (“Tree
                        Search”, see <ref type="crossref" target="#img15">Fig. 15</ref>), with an
                        XPath Search field and a number of predefined queries. It is possible to
                        choose between several options for the display of the results (brackets,
                        table graph, vertical graph, etc.). The XPath search operates on the PSDX
                        format containing the syntactic annotations in XML. The predefined queries
                        help to get started with the XPath expressions which can be quite complex
                        depending on the structure of interest. A search for adverbial clauses, for
                        example, is formulated as //eTree[@Label="CP-ADV"], a search for indirect
                        questions as //eTree[contains(@Label, "IP") and ./eTree[@Label="CP-QUE"]],
                        and for postverbal subjects //*[eTree[contains(@Label,
                        "NP-SBJ")]/preceding-sibling::eTree[contains(@Label, "VB")]]. The results
                        are displayed per sentence. A search for postverbal subjects, for example,
                        yields 1,700 results. A tree view of one of the resulting sentences (“corre
                        a fama” – “runs the rumour”) is given in <ref type="crossref" target="#img16">Fig. 16</ref>.</p>
               <p xml:id="p58">Both for the general corpus search and for the syntactic search,
                        basic help texts are offered. Not every search option is explained but the
                        information that is given helps the user to find his or her way through the
                        search forms when using the various access points that are offered to
                        explore <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> as a linguistic corpus.</p>
               <p xml:id="p59">Altogether, a remarkable range and amount of linguistic
                        information has been added to the edited texts of the letters and it has
                        been integrated convincingly into the entire text collection. The many
                        possibilities to search for specific linguistic annotations, to view them in
                        the context of the transcribed documents and to download almost all of the
                        generated information (the linguistic data itself, the search results, and
                        visualizations of corpus distributions as well as of linguistic details such
                        as single clauses) must be a great asset for a historical corpus linguist.
                        While the rich user interface supports qualitative as well as quantitative
                        work, the option to download all data in text- as well as XML-based formats
                        is ideal for researchers who would like to integrate the data into their own
                        technical workflow.</p>

            <head>Long-term prospects</head>
            <p xml:id="p60">Officially, <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> is a finished project.
                    On the website, no comments on the future of the data or the maintenance of the
                    project website itself are found. But even though the funding period ended in
                    2017, the user manual on the linguistic annotations was still updated in March
                    2018 and this reviewer got an immediate answer and help from the project
                    coordinator when the website was slowing down during the reviewing process. As
                    the project was based at the Linguistics Centre of the University of Lisbon and
                    is also technically hosted there, the prospects are good that there will be
                    institutional support for this digital text collection also in the future. The
                    graphical user interface is generated with the tool TEITOK, a platform that has
                    already been in use for 14 research projects, so it can be assumed that it will
                    also be maintained further on. Even if the website and user interface should be
                    shut down at some point, the underlying data is held in standard formats and
                    could be kept and used in other environments. Nothing is said on the website
                    about external repositories for the data. It would be an option to additionally
                    store the XML and text data in an infrastructure designed for the long-term, for
                    example at a CLARIN centre.<note xml:id="ftn59">See <ref target="https://www.clarin.eu/content/repositories">https://www.clarin.eu/content/repositories</ref>. Accessed June 1,
                        2018.</note>
            </p>
            <p xml:id="p61">In terms of documentation, it has already been said that many
                    publications have been produced in <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> contributing
                    to a whole range of disciplines. Not only has the project itself been documented
                    meticulously in the publications and manuals, but its results as a digital
                    scholarly edition and historical linguistic corpus have also already been made
                    fruitful in analytic research contributions by members of the project, securing
                    the transfer of knowledge from the project to the relevant disciplines.</p>
            <p xml:id="p62">An open question, which all project-based digital resources face, is
                    how to proceed with changes to the data. In <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph>,
                    the levels of encoding and annotation are not the same for all the data. This
                    has probably various reasons: two different languages that need to be dealt
                    with, data coming from preceding projects, decisions to change annotation
                    procedures, the end of the funding period, and many more. Although the ideal
                    would be to have completely homogenous, completed data, it is even more
                    important to communicate the state of the data clearly to give the users
                    orientation. In addition, an explicit contact address, a contact form, or a
                    ticket system could enable users to report anything that they come across while
                    using the platform. This could even be left unmonitored but would make it
                    possible to collect feedback for those who want to reuse the data or in case
                    there would be a follow-up project.</p>
            <p xml:id="p63">For the long run, a more explicit and detailed licensing of the data
                    is also important to ensure that other researchers take the opportunity to work
                    with the results of <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph>. As it is, the project‘s
                    strategy to grant free access to the data but to publish the TEI files under
                    copyright can not be considered an overall Open Access policy (see the <ref target="#p35">discussion of rights issues above</ref>).</p>
         </div>
         <div xml:id="div7">
            <head>Conclusion</head>
            <p xml:id="p64">
               <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> can certainly be classified both as a scholarly
                    digital edition and a diachronic linguistic corpus. It can be considered pioneer
                    work in combining procedures from textual criticism with the linguistic
                    preparation of the corpus — on the levels of the data model, the use of an
                    integrated research environment, and the presentation and possibilities of
                    interaction with the results on the website.</p>
            <p xml:id="p65">Valuable basic work has been done in collecting, transcribing, and
                    encoding the approximately 5,000 historical private letters kept in archives all
                    over the Iberian Peninsula and making them available to researchers and to the
                    public. The decision to make all basic data available for download is exemplary.
                    An open licence for would have been desirable for data reuse, but still it is
                    very useful to have insight into the data.</p>
            <p xml:id="p66">The project has followed community standards and advice from similar
                    editorial undertakings, thereby making its data reusable and prepared for the
                    future. The detailed documentation makes up for a partly complex combination of
                    data standards and tools, originating from the project’s history and its double
                    goal to edit the corpus critically and prepare it linguistically.</p>
            <p xml:id="p67">The site’s usability would have benefitted from more context
                    information directly presented on the website to guide a user not familiar with
                    the project and also to have the latest information about the selection, amount,
                    distribution, and state of the data in one place. It would have been good to
                    include filters for the availability of annotation layers into the search forms
                    (e.g. to only show letters with completed linguistic annotation). On the other
                    hand, some of the many visualization options for statistics and syntactic trees
                    could have been skipped. Still, the range of search options that have been
                    implemented for the graphical user interface is impressive. It could only have
                    been enhanced by more options to browse through the collection of letters.</p>
            <p xml:id="p68">It is to be hoped that this carefully edited and comprehensively
                    prepared corpus of private correspondence will be maintained and used by many
                    linguists, historians, and digital humanists to come.</p>
