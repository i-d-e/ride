               <emph>Digital Thoreau</emph> is a web resource comprising three digital projects
               related to the work of Henry David Thoreau created at SUNY Geneseo. The first of
               these is a fluid text edition of Thoreau’s most famous work <emph>Walden</emph>. This
               allows multiple versions of the text to be represented simultaneously in a dynamic
               environment, which can be a valuable resource to Thoreau scholars, particularly for
               those interested in researching the genetic aspect of the text. In the second project
               a very innovative and engaging social reading platform has been created in order to
               facilitate community and student driven annotation of both <emph>Walden</emph> and
               his 1849 essay <emph>Resistance to Civil Government</emph>. The third project is a
               student created digital archive of the papers of Thoreau scholar Walter Harding,
               which is primarily a pedagogical exercise in digital humanities for the students of
               SUNY Geneseo. <emph>Digital Thoreau</emph> as a whole is a multi-faceted web resource
               that offers interesting new opportunities for scholarly research as well as for
               teaching and public engagement with Thoreau’s influential works.</p>

               <emph>Walden</emph>, first published in 1854, is perhaps the best-known work of the
               nineteenth century American writer, philosopher, civil activist and abolitionist
               Henry David Thoreau. The work was Thoreau’s memoir of more than two years spent
               living in a cabin in the woods near Walden Pond in Concord, Massachusetts from 1845
               to 1847. Thoreau’s attempt to step away from contemporary society and live a simple
               and deliberate life in a one-room structure continues to resonate to this day as a
               symbol of individualism and anti-establishment civil disobedience.</p>

               <emph> Digital Thoreau</emph>, published by SUNY Geneseo, aims to build a resource
               and a community dedicated to promoting the deliberate reading of Thoreau's works in
               new ways, ways that take advantage of technology to illuminate Thoreau's creative
               process and facilitate thoughtful conversation about his words and ideas’ (Schacht
               2014a, homepage) It has been quite successful in achieving this goal and stands as an
               excellent example of a digital scholarly edition that is useful for scholarly and
               pedagogical purposes while also being enjoyable to engage with. In its presentation
               of <emph>Walden</emph> it provides a fluid text edition of seven variants of the
               publication and also a separate social reading edition of the book. Both of these
               digital representations of <emph>Walden</emph>, in my opinion, qualify as digital
               scholarly editions. They are both critical representations of a text that adhere to
               digital paradigms. The former is a fluid text variorum and the latter a digital
               edition of a text with social annotations, neither of these two outcomes could be
               realistically achieved in print form. <emph>Digital Thoreau</emph> also contains a
               third ‘project’ that will be discussed briefly in this review, which is essentially
               an exhibition of manuscripts of Walter Harding, a prominent scholar of the writer in
               question. The focus of this review will thus be primarily on an analysis of the fluid
               text edition and the reader’s edition presented by <emph>Digital Thoreau</emph>. Each
               of the projects will first be assessed in isolation before later reflecting on the
               resource as a whole.</p>

               <p xml:id="p3">The foundation stone of this genetic representation of the text is the
                  scholarship carried out by Ronald E. Clapper in his 1967 dissertation in which he
                  created a critical apparatus of the <emph>Walden</emph> manuscript HM924 at the
                  Huntington Library. This built on earlier scholarship conducted by H.M. Shanley
                  and the hypothesis that this particular manuscript was evidence that
                     <emph>Walden</emph> was created in seven distinct phases, thus represented in
                  Clapper’s critical apparatus. In this review I will not attempt to assess the
                  scholarship carried out by Clapper and Shanley but rather to consider the merits
                  and realization of the scholarship in the chosen digital representation as a fluid
                  text. The selection of Clapper’s representation of <emph>Walden</emph> is both a
                  practical choice and a very wise decision. Since Clapper’s dissertation is already
                  considered to be indispensible for Thoreau researchers it makes sense to build
                  upon the foundations of this well-established scholarship and attempt to see if
                  representing it in a new form can create space for new scholarly discussions and
                  conclusions on the text.</p>
               <p xml:id="p4">By taking the critical apparatus from Clapper’s dissertation used to
                  indicate variants and then encoding it in TEI XML the team at Digital Thoreau have
                  enabled the representation and display of the seven proposed variants of the text
                  using the <emph>Versioning Machine</emph>. The 1971 print edition of
                     <emph>Walden</emph> edited by Shanley is then used as a base edition to which
                  variants can be compared, in reality leaving the user with eight texts for
                  comparison. Conceptually this appears to have been a resounding success; users can
                  select any combination of one or all variants to read on screen beside each other
                  inside the Versioning Machine interface.</p>
               <p xml:id="p5">The edition intends to adhere to John Bryant’s principles concerning
                  fluid text which he laid out in 2002 in his book <emph>The Fluid Text: A Theory of
                     Revision and Editing for Book and Screen</emph>: <cit>
                     <quote>Simply put, a fluid text is any literary work that exists in more than
                        one version. It is ‘fluid’ because the versions flow from one to another.
                        Truth be told, all works – because of the nature of texts and creativity –
                        are fluid texts. Not only is this fluidity the inherent condition of any
                        written document; it is inherent in the phenomenon of writing itself. That
                        is, writing is fundamentally an arbitrary hence unstable approximation of
                        thought. Moreover, we revise words to make them more closely approximate our
                        thoughts, which in turn evolve as we write. And this condition and
                        phenomenon of textual fluidity is not a theoretical supposition; it is
                        fact.</quote>

               <p xml:id="p6">Bryant applied his fluid text principles in the creation of the
                  digital edition of Herman Melville’s 1846 book <emph>Typee</emph> (Bryant 2006).
                  This allows users to view two simultaneous views of a variety of combinations of
                  manuscript, print and diplomatic transcriptions of the work. This works well for
                  that particular project although the layout of two versions displayed one above
                  another would not work for <emph>Digital Thoreau</emph>, which can show eight
                  versions simultaneously in separate vertical columns. The <emph>Typee</emph>
                  edition also presents quite comprehensive information on the editorial principles
                  of editing this fluid text as well as insights into the work itself and the
                  process of how it was written and revised. However, this form of editorial
                  information is currently absent from <emph>Digital Thoreau</emph>. At present,
                  there is rather limited information to explain and justify its editorial concepts
                  and also any editorial decisions that were taken during the creation of the
                  edition. Ideally such an essay would need to provide further information on the
                  selection of Clapper’s dissertation, the decision to use the 1971 edition as its
                  base text, to provide some basic introduction to the principles of ‘fluid text’,
                  some information regarding decisions made in encoding of the text and perhaps some
                  information regarding choices of particular digital tools and software over any
                  alternatives. Paul Schacht is aware of this matter and has indicated to me that
                  there is a plan to provide a full editorial introduction to the edition that will
                  clarify these editorial principles and objectives in the near future. Users of the
                  edition might further benefit if the editors took this one step further by
                  including specific ‘revision narratives’, which are an additional aspect of
                  Bryant’s fluid text model. Revision narratives are intended to provide
                  individualised informative narratives of each site of revision of the text and
                  serve as a direct means of contact between the editors and the readers of a fluid
                  text (Bryant 2002, 159-160). Another planned additional feature for <emph>Digital
                     Thoreau</emph> will be the inclusion of facsimiles of manuscripts for
                  comparison with the genetic text; this has the potential to be a great enhancement
                  if integrated well in the edition. Furthermore, they hope to incorporate comment
                  and annotation features into this environment that may enhance user engagement and
                  interaction. </p>
               <p xml:id="p7">Can it be considered to be a genetic edition of <emph>Thoreau</emph>?
                  There are multiple definitions that can be drawn upon to help establish this.
                  Looking at the three English language definitions of ‘genetic edition’ in the <emph>
                     <ref target="http://uahost.uantwerpen.be/lse/index.php/lexicon/genetic-edition/">Lexicon of Scholarly Editing</ref>
                  </emph> I believe the answer is yes. It certainly meets the requirements of
                  Kline’s definition when she states that a genetic-text edition is a ‘textual
                  edition that tries to offer the reader access to more than one level of textual
                  creation within a single page’ – or in this case within a single screen. Bryant’s
                  own definition from his <emph>Fluid Text</emph> publication is also clearly
                  applicable as it stands as an edition ‘which integrates coded, sequentialized
                  variants into the reading text.’ The final and strictest definition comes from
                  Grésillon via Van Hulle, that it ‘should contain the reproduction of all the
                  genetic documents, bibliographical descriptions, and an introduction regarding the
                  location of the manuscript and the general history of its genesis, comprising
                  letters and other relevant evidence.’ The project does not meet the requirements
                  of this particular definition of genetic criticism as these features are clearly
                  absent. That is not to say that this particular representation of multiple
                  variants on a single screen has no value for genetic critics, in fact I believe
                  quite the opposite is true. This digital representation should be a very useful
                  environment for scholars to develop hypotheses relating to the writing process and
                  other related research questions which they could investigate in further detail
                  elsewhere using additional materials. As Shillingsburg and Van Hulle argue digital
                  environments are ideal for genetic research: ‘Whereas, in scholarly editing,
                  manuscript analysis is often seen as a means to an end, that is, a tool to make an
                  edition, genetic criticism reverses these roles and sees the making of an edition
                  as a tool to facilitate manuscript analysis’ (Shillingsburg and Van Hulle 2015,
                  36). The very fact that the text used for these variants are based on witnesses
                  hypothesised by Clapper also allows the opportunity to perform further research to
                  confirm or disconfirm the various passages and witnesses which his piece of
                  scholarship presented.</p>
               <p xml:id="p8">The Fluid Text Edition of <emph>Walden</emph> can still be considered
                  to be a work-in-progress. Nonetheless, the absence of an editorial essay even at
                  this stage of the edition’s development stands as the crucial shortcoming of
                     <emph>Digital Thoreau</emph> as a scholarly resource. This does not impact
                  greatly on the usability of the edition as a tool but it does detract
                  significantly from its scholarly credibility. For users who are not specialist
                  scholars of Thoreau, little information is provided regarding the scholarship that
                  led to the hypothesis that the HM924 manuscript is evidence of the work being
                  drafted in seven distinct phases for example. Such a user is left to either take
                  this hypothesis for granted or to seek out original scholarship elsewhere.</p>

               <head>Technical background</head>
               <p xml:id="p9">The Versioning Machine was developed by Susan Schreibman whilst
                  working at the Maryland Institute, first released in 2002 and this version dates
                  to 2010. The purpose of the software is to allow multiple variants of a TEI
                  encoded text to be compared on screen side by side. The creators of <emph>Digital
                     Thoreau</emph> have not indicated why they chose the Versioning Machine over
                  other alternatives such as CollateX. The advantage of using CollateX, for example,
                  is its extensive documentation on the collation algorithms employed and the
                  possibility to modify them. CollateX, however, requires a much higher level of
                  technical skill to install and operate. Perhaps the Versioning Machine may have
                  been chosen because it is relatively user-friendly. Schreibman herself has
                  described the Versioning Machine as ‘a piece of software in a box designed for
                  non-programmers’ (Hansen 2013). The construction of the edition is also in some
                  ways used as a pedagogical exercise for students of SUNY who have been and
                  continue to be involved in the creation of the edition and perhaps due to this it
                  made sense to utilise more out-of-the-box software options (cf. Hucalak and
                  Richardson 2013).</p>
               <p xml:id="p10">The Versioning Machine by design does not require users to choose a
                  base version of the text but can potentially compare any version of the text with
                  any other. In this case the print edition by Shanley has been selected as a base
                  text to which all seven variants of the manuscript text are compared. The column
                  displaying the base edition can be closed allowing you to view two or more
                  manuscript versions simultaneously, although the comparative visualisation still
                  relates to the base version. A column containing bibliographic information appears
                  on the left that can be toggled off to make space, as can an optional column of
                  notes on the right-hand side. Columns can be scrolled independently of each other;
                  this allows the user to read different parts of the text at the same time. A
                  slightly frustrating issue with the software is that when navigating between
                  different chapters the view returns to displaying the two default versions rather
                  than retaining the combination of versions you had chosen to display. There is
                  functionality provided for reporting issues – built into the bibliographic
                  information panel – but this was not working at the time of review. The variations
                  in text between versions are clearly indicated using a simple but effective font
                  colour scheme indicated in the bibliographic information column on the left, which
                  indicate unchanged text, changes in text, interpolations, interlineations and
                  strikethroughs.</p>

                  </figure> The Versioning Machine fluid text interface in <emph>Digital
                     Thoreau</emph> perhaps leaves a little to be desired regarding its visual
                  appearance as it appears quite dated in terms of design. However, it is extremely
                  functional and very easy to use which in many ways makes up for any aesthetic
                  shortcomings. In my opinion the software is quite user-friendly and intuitive, all
                  of its functionality was clear to me after just a few short moments due to the
                  simplicity of its layout. Despite this clarity the project team have also kindly
                  provided a user guide for this particular edition. The project team have indicated
                  that improvements are planned for customising this interface design in the future.
                  At present the user is confronted with the standard Versioning Machine web
                  interface that provides no navigation back to the general <emph>Digital
                     Thoreau</emph> site but rather stands in isolation. The Versioning Machine
                  software also allows for inclusion of facsimile images, which are displayed as a
                  popup window that can be clicked on each column. However, this is a rather clunky
                  design and would not be the best way to present the manuscript facsimiles when
                  they are ready for inclusion. A customised interface that allows for the display
                  of both texts and facsimiles simultaneously in separate columns would be better as
                  would a responsive design that allows it to adapt to smaller screen sizes such as
                  tablets. A recent blog post on the site has indicated that they are busy working
                  on such an improved interface and also that they will make the interface more
                  accessible on tablet screens ‘for scholars who want to read Thoreau in the library
                  and woods alike’ (Schacht 2014b, <ref target="http://web.archive.org/web/20160608091603/http://digitalthoreau.org/life-in-the-digital-woods-walden-a-fluid-text-updated/">Life in the Digital Woods</ref>) – an improvement which would likely be much
                  appreciated by many users.</p>
               <p xml:id="p12">The TEI XML files are made available for the user to download as a
                  compressed zip or tar file. The TEI encoding of the text was conducted to some
                  extent by students of SUNY Geneseo, although it is unclear to what extent scholars
                  may have been involved in the process of encoding or training the students and
                  checking their output. A recent upgrade of the edition has also made the XSLT
                  source code available in the same way. In this upgrade the project team state that
                  they have cleaned up various textual errors and bugs reported by users. It also
                  includes the addition of a very useful ‘Data Dictionary’ which provides a list and
                  definitions of the TEI elements and attributes employed in encoding the text,
                  aimed at both beginners and advanced users of TEI (Schacht 2014a, <ref target="http://web.archive.org/web/20160608092026/http://www.digitalthoreau.org/walden/fluid/dict/">Data Dictionary for Walden</ref>). Finally, the students at Geneseo have
                  encoded Thoreau’s own journal annotations regarding the text and plugged them into
                  the Versioning Machine as notes, which adds another interesting dimension to allow

                  already was a prominent Thoreau scholar and the subject of the third ‘project’
                  within <emph>Digital Thoreau</emph>. This format creates an interesting discourse,
                  whereby annotations from the 1960s sit alongside comments from current users –
                  gathering different generations of scholarship together in one place, as if in
                  conversation with each other. More recently the editors have added a second text,
                  that being Thoreau’s other well-known work <emph>Resistance to Civil
                     Government</emph>. They have included it in its original form as an essay
                  published in an anthology called <emph>Aesthetic Papers</emph> in 1849. This more
                  recent addition does not presently display any annotations from earlier
                  scholarship as they have done with the <emph>Walden text</emph>.</p>

                  </figure> Within the Readers’ Thoreau project there are two separate interfaces
                  deriving from two plugins utilised in this WordPress website. The landing pages
                  and community forums are presented as Commons in a Box interfaces and the reading
                  edition has been built using the CommentPress plugin. The usage of this
                  combination of tools is quite sensible – although the different interfaces yet
                  again make the overall resource slightly fragmented. Hopefully plans to update the
                  design across <emph>Digital Thoreau</emph> will also improve the integration of
                  these interfaces.</p>
               <p xml:id="p15">CommentPress is an open source theme and plugin for WordPress that
                  was developed by a think tank called The Institute for the Future of the Book. One
                  advantage of using the WordPress theme is its responsive design; it works well on
                  both tablet and mobile devices. The only hindrance to this is that the user must
                  navigate through the landing pages of Readers’ Thoreau which, although responsive,
                  make it a little unclear how to navigate to the reading text. Tablets are highly
                  social devices; industry statistics show that the use of social media is the
                  second only to gaming on mobile/tablet devices in terms of time spent per app
                  (Bosomworth 2015). Thus, they are potentially an excellent platform for social
                  reading activities. Paul Schacht seems to have made an earlier attempt at this
                  type of social edition using <ref target="http://digress.it">Digress</ref> and a
                  text from Project Gutenberg (Schacht 2013).</p>

                        tablet screen".</head>
                  </figure>The CommentPress reading interface is divided into three tabbed columns,
                  a central one for the text and a tab on either side for the table of contents and
                  commenting section. In the reading text itself, the pagination of the first
                  edition is replaced by larger groupings of paragraphs on longer scrollable pages,
                  which minimises the necessity to ‘turn pages’ (click forward/back arrows) and
                  makes for a much more effective division of reading sections for reading on a
                  screen. The division claims to be two or more pages per screen from text in the
                  print edition, and in many cases it seems to be closer to four of the original
                  pages. The numbering of paragraphs seems to be concurrent with the first edition
                  although this numeration is not explicitly explained to the user. Comments are
                  arranged in connection to a whole paragraph or in relation to an entire page.
                  Users can also toggle to an ‘Activity’ tab within the ‘Comments’ tab which links
                  in directly to the discussion forums and vice versa. Users who wish to contribute
                  must join a discussion group on the site and comments left are connected to this
                  group. A typical user can join the ‘General Discussion’ group, but there is also a
                  ‘Panel of Experts’ group for selected Thoreau scholars that is openly available
                  for anyone to read. Additionally there are several individual university class
                  groups that are using this site for teaching and learning activities. There does
                  not appear to be any form of moderation of created annotations, although it would
                  be useful to explicitly state this in the project overview. The <ref target="http://commonsinabox.org/">Commons In A Box</ref> plugin provides a
                  fairly typical and straightforward forum-type interface for online discussion
                  developed at CUNY. The separate groups each have various discussion threads. Users
                  can reply to a thread or ‘favourite’ particular comments. It provides lists of all
                  the other users, access to an activity stream of every action taking place in the
                  website and some basic help information. Another area that needs some
                  clarification is the sustainability of the annotation data: is the data somehow
                  preserved in an XML document or is it just part of the Commons in A Box interface
                  and stored in a database, which has no connection to the text?</p>
            </div>
            <div xml:id="div3.2">
               <head>A social edition?</head>
               <p xml:id="p17">The project is described in the introductory section as a ‘social
                  edition’ which they define as ‘a text that makes room for readers’ comments and
                  conversations’ (Schacht 2014a, <ref target="http://commons.digitalthoreau.org/">The Readers' Thoreau</ref>). It certainly does utilise social software around
                  a recognised edition of the text but it is perhaps a matter of interpretation and
                  chosen definitions as to what extent it constitutes something you could call a
                  social edition. Equally one could discuss whether it can be accurately described
                  as being ‘scholarly’. Annotation is indeed one of the ‘scholarly primitives’ as
                  described by John Unsworth (Unsworth 2000). Placing this activity in a
                  collaborative, social environment is certainly valuable and effective. Readers
                  using this platform can see commentary added both by known scholars of Thoreau in
                  the Panel of Experts section and by more general users. Discussion between experts
                  and general users in no way diminishes the scholarly quality of the commentary
                  provided but rather has the capacity to enhance it. It also provides various
                  functionalities not possible in a print environment such as searching and the
                  interactivity between the text, the discussion forum and its users. On that basis
                  I believe that Readers’ Thoreau can be classified as a digital scholarly edition
                  even by quite strict definitions. Laying down any kind of definition for a ‘social
                  edition’ is less straightforward as there is little scholarly consensus regarding
                  the relatively new concept. Ray Siemens et al. in their exploration of modelling
                  the social edition laid out five modes of social editing: collaborative
                  annotation, user-derived content, folksonomy tagging, community bibliography, and
                  shared text-analysis (Siemens 2012, 451-452). Readers’ Thoreau provides a space
                  for the first item in this list but none of the others, which is not to say that a
                  social edition should or could address all five of these modes simultaneously.
                  Readers’ Thoreau is primarily a social reading edition of one particular variant
                  of the text. It does not go as far as, say, the <emph>Social Edition of the
                     Devonshire Manuscript</emph>, which was developed by the Electronic Textual
                  Cultures Laboratory at the University of Victoria as a Wikibook (Siemens et al
                  2014). A Wikibook allows users to edit the text itself, but in the case of
                  Readers’ Thoreau users can only create annotations. The ambition here does not
                  appear to be the creation of a newly edited text but rather to provide a social
                  space in which to engage with that particular text. The edition facilitates
                  interaction among its community of practice. In this domain it is extremely
                  successful, with a highly engaged user community commenting and annotating on a
                  regular basis. To give some sense of quantity, at the time of review there were
                  500 ‘active’ members, of these 40 were active within the last month alone. There
                  were 20 discussion groups with up to 98 members each; the majority of these being
                  private university groups and the open group called ‘General Discussion’ had 76
                  members.</p>
               <p xml:id="p18">One of the ambitions of the reading edition is to allow for what
                  Thoreau would have described as deliberate reading. In the third chapter of
                     <emph>Walden</emph> he makes clear his opinions on the act of reading: ‘To read
                  well, that is, to read true books in a true spirit, is a noble exercise, and one
                  that will task the reader more than any exercise which the customs of the day
                  esteem. It requires a training such as the athletes underwent, the steady
                  intention almost of the whole life to this object. Books must be read as
                  deliberately and reservedly as they were written’ (Thoreau in <emph>Walden</emph>,
                  Schacht 2014a, 3.3). The reading environment certainly creates a space for
                  thoughtful reading in deliberation with other members of the community for further
                  consideration and discussion. If Thoreau's living in the woods was a sort of
                  social experiment then Readers’ Thoreau can also be seen as a social experiment in
                  reading, an experiment which has succeeded in creating an engaged community of
                  readers. It would also be interesting to see if there are any ambitions to
                  integrate these annotations with the fluid text in some way in the future.</p>

               </figure> The third ‘project’ within <emph>Digital Thoreau</emph> is a student led
               venture that intends to publish digitally the archival materials left by Walter
               Harding to tell the story of his life as a scholar, teacher and activist. Harding is
               described in the overview as arguably the twentieth century’s most important scholar
               of Thoreau (Schacht 2014a, <ref target="http://walterharding.org/">http://walterharding.org/</ref>). He was a member of the English Department at
               SUNY Geneseo and published a number of publications on Thoreau as well as
               accumulating a very large research collection on the man. Students from SUNY Geneseo
               built a website which is a digital archive providing access to catalogued images and
               thematic exhibitions of more than 100 archival items housed at the university library
               ranging from photographs to correspondence with important figures such as Martin
               Luther King Jr. The intention is for future students to develop this resource
               further. It is built as an <ref target="http://omeka.org">Omeka</ref> site, a
               web-publishing tool designed specifically for displaying collections and exhibitions.
               Omeka is a sensible choice as it is open source, user-friendly and is probably the
               leader in the field of nonproprietary tools for creating online collections and
               exhibitions. The collection is definitely still a work in progress, which at this
               point in time does not provide a great deal of added value to <emph>Digital
                  Thoreau</emph> as a whole. However, as it grows and develops it can potentially
               provide some useful contextual background on the life of the man who has provided the
               basis of annotations for the reading edition in this resource and much of the most
               important Thoreau scholarship ever done. It is also highly commendable both as a
               pedagogical exercise in teaching students about the interactions between literature
               and technology and in its dedication to a collaborative community orientated
               edition.</p>

            <head>Conclusion</head>
            <p xml:id="p20">
               <emph>Digital Thoreau</emph> with its fluid text edition has succeeded in utilising
               the tools of the TEI community, XML encoding and the Versioning Machine, and
               harnessed them to create a resource that is valuable for both scholarly research and
               pedagogical endeavours. <emph>Digital Thoreau</emph> as a whole is in fact a
               testament to the successful implementation of many open source DH tools when
               considering its usage of CommentPress and Commons in a Box for Readers’ Thoreau and
               the usage of Omeka for the Walter Harding project and other widely available
               publishing technologies such as WordPress.</p>
            <p xml:id="p21">The main aesthetic and practical criticism of <emph>Digital
                  Thoreau</emph> lies in its slightly fragmented structure and design. Some
               consistency of design between the three ‘projects’ of <emph>Digital Thoreau</emph>
               would make all the offerings of the resource seem more coherent and apparent for the
               user. Something as simple as a shared header or banner and more consistent routes of
               navigation between its constituent parts could be an easy and effective enhancement.
               The main cause of scholarly apprehension stems from the scarcity of detailed
               editorial information regarding the construction of the edition. These shortcomings
               can definitely be rectified and the editors have expressed an awareness of these
               matters and intend to address them as soon as they can.</p>
            <p xml:id="p22">The combination of the three very different types of project within
                  <emph>Digital Thoreau</emph> provides the resource with multiple channels of
               dissemination to relatively diverse audiences. The fluid text provides a valuable
               resource to textual scholars to trace the genetic writing process of this influential
               writer. The Walter Harding project has been harnessed as a pedagogical exercise for
               students at the home institution of the edition and it can potentially contribute
               some interesting insights into Thoreau scholarship as a whole. The reading edition is
               significant for the scholarly community, university course students and the wider
               public by making available a user friendly digital reading edition embedded within a
               community environment that knits together diverse interested parties. In my personal
               opinion Readers’ Thoreau is the most exciting component of the overall project and
               represents a real and original contribution to the field of digital editing and its
               methods of user engagement and pedagogical experimentation.</p>
            <p xml:id="p23">The project occupies an entirely new space within Thoreau scholarship.
               There is a major on-going project to produce a full scholarly edition of his complete
               works in print form led by the University of California, with 17 volumes of a planned
               28 now published by Princeton University Press (Witherell 1971-present). In the
               digital sphere there already exists a project called <emph>The Thoreau Reader</emph>,
               which was created by Iowa State University in conjunction with the Thoreau Society
               (Lenat 2009). This provides annotated editions of his books and essays alongside
               academic essays and other contextual educational documents but has not been updated
               since 2009. <emph>Digital Thoreau</emph> could perhaps benefit from some cooperation
               with these projects or consider providing some similar contextual materials in its
               modern digital environment.</p>
            <p xml:id="p24">
               <emph>Digital Thoreau</emph> is continuing to develop and grow and will undoubtedly
               provide increasing value to Thoreau scholarship. It is also admirable that the
                  <emph>Digital Thoreau</emph> project as a whole really tries to reflect Thoreau’s
               own philosophy and the message he attempted to convey in <emph>Walden</emph>,
               advocating for simple and deliberate living and indeed for deliberate reading.</p>
