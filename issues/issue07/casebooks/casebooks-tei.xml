            <p>This essay reviews <emph>The Casebooks Project</emph>, an ambitious attempt to
               digitize 80,000 astrological medical records from early modern England. <emph>The
                  Casebooks Project</emph> exemplifies the possibilities of using digital
               technologies to understand early modern cultural and intellectual history, and offers
               us insight into the process of creating such a project. However, it remains unclear
               who the project’s audience is, whether to see it purely as a ‘dataset’ or as a
               textual-based digital edition, and how public-facing the project wants to be. This
               review seeks to use the digital edition and Dr. Lauren Kassell’s ongoing scholarly
               and public reflections on the project to highlight the project’s successes and
               suggest further possibilities it may inspire.</p>

               <emph>The Casebooks Project</emph> highlights the interdisciplinary, qualitative, and
               quantitative potential digital technologies can offer scholars. It encourages
               researchers to explore thousands of otherwise indecipherable written records from the
               early modern era, and aims to focus the reader’s attention on the materiality of
               those records and the performative uses of writing and note-taking. As Lauren Kassell
               herself puts it, ‘It [<emph>The Casebooks Project</emph>] uses digital technologies
               to understand what were, in the seventeenth century, new paper technologies’ (2016,
               120). This project stands out not only because of its scope and breadth, but also
               Kassell’s willingness to publically engage in self-critical reflection. In doing so,
               she allows us to access not only the project but the process of producing it: an
               invaluable opportunity for both amateurs and novices in the digital humanities.<note xml:id="ftn1">Joshua Kruchten is a former graduate student of English and American

            <head>What are Casebooks?</head>
            <p xml:id="p4">Early modern medical writing conforms to a variety of specific genres;
               Gianna Pomata, historian of medicine, suggests these genres are ‘highly structured
               and clearly recognizable textual conventions’ (2010, 197). By noticing changes in
               what she sees as ‘the disappearance, emergence, and transformation of epistemic
               genres,’ researchers can track ‘profound transformations in ways of thinking,
               collective and individual’ (Pomata 2010, 198). Pomata tracks the late-Renaissance
               genre of <emph>observationes</emph>, or collections of narrated medical cases, which
               first appear in connection to the astral sciences and move into law and medicine in
               the 16th century (2010, 204).</p>
            <p xml:id="p5">Kassell focuses on a slightly different genre, casebooks, which she
               describes as ‘material and intellectual artifacts of medical practice,’ often the
               only surviving trace of the early modern medical encounter itself (2014, 596). To
               differentiate them from other forms of note-taking or narrative records, she
               describes casebooks as primarily ‘serial records of practice’ (Kassell 2014, 600).
               Casebooks are thus emblematic of changing medical practice and cultural attitudes
               towards patients and disease (Kassell 2014, 603, Hess and Mendelsohn 2010).</p>
            <p xml:id="p6">The first practitioner in England whose astrological records survive are
               those of Richard Trewythian, who kept several dozen calculations between 1442 and
               1458 (Kassell 2014, 608). Between 1450 and 1700, Kassell identifies thirty-six extant
               sets of medical casebooks and eleven sets of astrological casebooks in England (2014,
               600). Her survey of astrological casebooks suggests several early figures, such as
               Johannes Schöner, Thomas Bodier, and an anonymous astrologer who recorded,
               respectively, from several dozen cases to several dozen pages of cases and questions
               (Kassell 2014, 608, 609).</p>
            <p xml:id="p7">One astrologer in particular, Simon Forman, occupies a central place in
               the history of casebooks, and more broadly, the history of medicine, the history of
               astrology, and intellectual history. Forman was ‘probably the most popular astrologer
               in Elizabethan London,’ and his records show a ‘practice of alchemy, natural magic,
               astrology, and medicine’ (Kassell 1999, 3, 4). Yet Forman, who was not formally
               educated and was in frequent conflict with the College of Physicians, enough to at
               one point even require leaving London to continue his practice, ‘figures in all of
               these accounts, sometimes as a charlatan, sometimes as a womanizer, and sometimes as
               a testament to the popularity of astrology; he has not been considered in his own
               right as an influence on the history of astrology or medicine’ (Kassell 1999).
               Countering this misconception, Kassell notes, ‘his and Napier [his successor]’s
               records are more systematic and extensive than anything else that survives’ (2014,
               610). Their notebooks, spanning from 1596 to 1603, offer themselves up as a rich and
               unparalleled source of biographical, medical, and local information.</p>
            <p xml:id="p8">In the encounter, Forman and Napier would record the querent’s name and
               the exact time of the consultation, occasionally biographical information, and
               whether or not the querent was asking on behalf of someone else (Kassell 1999, 4). A
               chart was often drawn up, using techniques appropriate to astrology, geomancy, or
                  numerology,<note xml:id="ftn3">Types of astrology in the Casebooks are described

               therapeutic treatment was recorded (Kassell 1999, 4).</p>
            <p xml:id="p9">As such, the casebooks are particularly interesting not just for how they
               recorded, but also shaped, the medical encounter. For example, Kassell states, ‘The
               astrologer and his patient negotiated an exchange of trust for true judgments.
               Casebooks were central to this dynamic. They were instruments for judging the causes
               of disease, status objects demonstrating the astrologer’s expertise, and records of
               these practices. With pen and paper, the astrologer located each patient within the
               cosmos and signaled his authority to do so’ (Kassell 2014, 598). In turn,
               encountering these books through digital technologies can offer a window into what
               early modern medical practitioners’ lives were like, what the personal and medical
               lives of average, everyday men and women were like, and how early modern medical
               practitioners used paper and writing as tools for memory assistance and
               authority.</p>

               <emph>The Casebooks Project</emph>, then, seeks to digitize, tag, and render
               searchable the astrological casebooks of both Forman and his successor, Richard
               Napier, which is the largest collection of such encounters in the history of early
               modern medicine. It specifically aims to provide researchers with quantitative and
               qualitative data generated from encoding the medical encounter. Because of the rich
               data this project generates, this scholarly digital edition lends itself to use not
               only by historians of medicine, but historians of science, local historians, and
               intellectual and social historians.</p>
            <p xml:id="p11">Aims and methods of the project are publically available, and include
               generating freely accessible, searchable transcriptions of both normalized and
               diplomatic versions, providing a platform for users to search the entire corpus or
               browse the entries sequentially, providing tabular CSV displays of the metadata,
               tracking specific individuals in the records and locating them within networks of
               relationships, and providing files in multiple formats, such as XHTML or even as a

            <p xml:id="p12">Kassell sees the project as building on the content and methodology of
               Michael MacDonald’s <emph>Mystical Bedlam: Madness, Anxiety and Healing in
                  Seventeenth-Century England</emph>, and changing trends towards recovering lost
               patient voices; ‘MacDonald used a mainframe, in my initial work on Forman I used a
               laptop and a spreadsheet, the Casebooks Project uses XML and programs for processing
               its data and metadata. This is an example of what Tim Hitchcock has referred to as
               the use of computers to address the ‘human contents’ of the past, to recover the
               voices of ordinary people…’ (2016, 217). This project is, in other words, not merely
               an attempt to reconstruct written records and better understand practitioners and
               practice, but to reach a more nuanced understanding of patients and their
               experiences.</p>
            <p xml:id="p13">Of the 80,000 cases, 48,514 are currently available to browse or search
               as fully transcribed entries with associated images. An additional 1,992 cases have
               been ‘calendared,’ or in other words, dates, as well as names of querents and
               consultants, have been provided, but no other data has been transcribed. For
               transcribed cases, the editors focus on the ‘question’ component of the medical
               encounter, which includes the date and time, biographical information about the
               patient, and detailed information about the medical consultation. Other information
               is included on an as-needed basis, and specific editorial policies are publicly

               decision to exclude ‘extraneous material,’ such as ‘remarks about the day’s weather,
               lists of expenses or medicines, news about the recovery or death of former patients,
               records of events in the practitioner’s own life, and so forth’.<note xml:id="ftn5">For editorial policies, see: <ref target="http://web.archive.org/web/20170310223812/http://www.magicandmedicine.hps.cam.ac.uk/using-our-edition/editorial-policies">http://web.archive.org/web/20170310223812/http://www.magicandmedicine.hps.cam.ac.uk/using-our-edition/editorial-policies</ref>.</note>
               Transcribing 80,000 records is already a formidable task, and as the editorial team
               poignantly remarks, ‘a full-text critical edition of the entire corpus is
               ‘logistically and financially impossible.’’<note xml:id="ftn6">See <ref type="crossref" target="#ftn4">note 4</ref>.</note> I wonder, however, what
               kinds of rich information this extraneous material might provide us not only about
               the economics of early modern medical practice and biographical information for
               Forman, Napier, and their patients, but also the interactions between practitioner
               and patient which occurred outside of the boundaries of the casebook. Though we might
               desire to hunt for traces of patients’ voices and their extra-textual interactions,
               however, Kassell cautions that the casebooks only represent one side of the story:
               ‘we do not have a single patient’s account of a consultation with Forman’ (1999, 18).
               She continues, in a more recent discussion of the <emph>Casebooks: </emph>‘The
               records were framed within conventions of writing narratives and collecting data;
               they are not, as we will see, unmediated records of experiences of illness and
               healing’ (Kassell 2016, 126). Regardless, the already-transcribed material contains
               extensive biographical and medical information available for research.</p>

                  <head type="legend">Breakdown of ‘Lunatics’ by age.</head>
               </figure> In addition, the editorial team conceives of this project as more of a
               ‘data set’ rather than a ‘textual edition’, despite its textual roots. This
               quantitative approach is one of the more exciting features the project offers. After
               searching by a wide range of topics (both medical and non-medical alike) or limiting
               factors, the project offers its users the ability to generate a ‘results summary’ for
               any given search. For example: a quick search for the topic of ‘lunatic’ underneath
               the category ‘illnesses of the mind’ generates 152 cases.<note xml:id="ftn7">I
                  performed a search using the topic for ‘lunatic.’ Those results are available <ref target="http://web.archive.org/web/20170310223843/http://www.magicandmedicine.hps.cam.ac.uk/the-casebooks/search/cases/results/summarise?t=166&amp;tm=10&amp;nt1=1">here</ref>. </note> Results include the percentage of querents asking on
               someone else’s behalf, the date range of the cases, a summary of cases by practice
               and practitioner, the type and number of topics associated with the selected cases,
               and information about the querent and patient, including ages, genders, and
               information about frequent patients. These quantitative data seems immediately
               useful; for example, it appears most querents were female, rather than male, and
               younger, rather than older; there are entries for 15 male subjects between 20-29 in
               contrast to 46 female subjects. Immediately we could imagine how even this cursory
               search might be useful for a researcher working out the story of gender and madness
               in the early modern period. At the same time, whether these results are statistically
               significant is still up for discussion, and there does not appear to be an option to
               download these data directly from the search interface. To do so would require
               software and training to sift through the raw XML files, available at <ref target="http://web.archive.org/web/20170310223514/https://github.com/CasebooksProject">http://web.archive.org/web/20170310223514/https://github.com/CasebooksProject</ref>,

               states that this is not a public engagement project, but instead designed to ‘make

                  remarks by Dr. Kassell from a panel given at NYU, ‘Inscription, Digitization and
                  the Shape of Knowledge,’ for the NYU Center for the Humanities. The event was
                  recorded and archived, and is publicly available on the NYU Center for the

               has written explicitly to a scholarly audience about Forman and the
                  <emph>Casebooks</emph>, she has also written to a more public audience in the UK
               magazine <emph>History Today</emph> in September 2011 (Kassell 2011). In her review
               in <emph>The Edinburgh Companion to the Critical Medical Humanities</emph>, she
               defines the project’s audience as ‘users, not readers, and one of the challenges of
               the project is to tutor them in engaging critically with the casebooks’ (Kassell
               2016, 127); in her earlier article in <emph>History Today</emph> she suggests that
               ‘it [the project] will also coach its users in the nature of these records…allowing
               scholars to explore the ways in which matters of health and questions about fortune
               more generally were socially constituted’ (Kassell 2011, 25). Yet the reach of this
               project has grown beyond only ‘scholarly’ limitations; the team maintains a humorous

               </figure> On the one hand, the issue of ‘public engagement’ and audience may be far
               less contentious than I have outlined here. The Wellcome Trust, the largest source of
               funding for the project, may not simply define the project as such in its rubrics and
               assessments for funding: without direct access to funding documentation, I could not
               say for sure. Nevertheless, the question of audience raises serious issues about the
               impact of the project and its core vision. Said otherwise, the audience for a project
               dictates which elements of the casebooks are transcribed and edited and which are
               excluded. By reproducing these extensive and rare manuscripts as a digital edition
               for an academic audience, the editors can more easily and efficiently navigate thorny
               issues of reproducing extinct symbols and the rich astrological charts Forman and
               Napier drew. A scholarly digital edition, unlike a print edition, allows researchers
               to index, search, and manipulate robust quantitative data from an otherwise
               unpublished body of subjective case entries. Although the specific day-to-day content
               in Forman and Napier’s journals may not be different from other extant astrological
               casebooks or medical records, the sheer quantity of entries may provide rich
               biographical, social, or medical data for a researcher. Yet distilling the
               qualitative content of the 80,000 cases in the manuscripts into quantitative data
               already presents methodological and epistemological questions. A “tweet" summary of a
               medical case complicates this problematic even further. Can one represent the rich
               quantitative results of a custom search, or even the complicated metadata from a
               single case, in less than 280 characters? What lessons are followers of the Twitter
               account learning from these case summaries? Careful attention needs to be paid to the
               represenation of scholarly editions on social media platforms, and this example
               highlights just how radically different the experience of reading a tweet, or even a
               single case summary, is from handling the manuscript or a printed facsimile of
               it.</p>
            <p xml:id="p28">The question of how to link research tools with social media is not a
               problem uniquely for the <emph>Casebooks Project</emph> to answer, but is one
               scholarly projects will increasingly need to grapple with in the future. Obviously,
               scholars will need different resources than a public audience, and if this project
               ultimately conceives of itself as an academic ‘dataset’ and not a public engagement
               project, then we should ask what non-scholarly users would <emph>do</emph> with the
               data generated. Or, if the project does wish to eventually develop a sustainable
               public-facing component, one must ask; can creative, public initiatives like the
               partnership with Ambika P3 inform or push the boundaries of scholarly research? In
               this case, can artistic or extra scholarly efforts help the scholarly digital editon
               represent the experiential and material nature of these books in a way that
               transcription alone cannot?</p>

            <head>Conclusion and Further Directions</head>
            <p xml:id="p29">This project—despite unresolved tension as to whether it conceives of
               itself as primarily a textually-based edition or a ‘dataset’—still conforms to
               scholarly standards and should be considered a scholarly digital edition; the textual
               tradition is clearly documented, editorial decisions are transparent, and the work is
               of excellent scholarly quality. Further, this edition has clearly accomplished most
               of its ambitious aims and methods, even though the complete 80,000 records are not
               yet transcribed.</p>
            <p xml:id="p30">In a panel discussion of her work at New York University this past
               February, Kassell acknowledged some of the tensions mentioned in this review, through
               a framework of seven key questions about her own work: what does it mean to create a
               new archive from an old archive? What is a casebook? Is the project editing what the
               astrologer wrote, or the narrated encounter itself? How do we help readers navigate?
               What is the tension between front-end presentation and durability? How can the site
               be made appealing? And how can users navigate ‘flattened’ data which may not be
               necessarily statistically significant?</p>
            <p xml:id="p31">In this discussion, Kassell clarified several editorial decisions and
               processes not necessarily evident from the main site itself. In terms of durability,
               for example, the front-end of the project is currently moving to a new home at the
               University of Cambridge Libraries. Kassell’s main points of pride are not the
               front-end developments, but instead the XML and encoded case files, currently
               available from GitHub, and an index developed by the editorial team. The index is of
               particular interest, because the contemporary early modern invention of the index
               radically altered how cases were organized and conceptualized. That Forman and
               Napier’s work itself was <emph>not</emph> indexed gives as insight into how digital
               technologies can help us recreate and understand conceptual shifts in informational
               management strategies and shifts in early modern reading and writing habits.</p>
            <p xml:id="p32">I was also struck by Kassell’s ruminations on what exactly is being
               edited: the written material, or the medical encounter. This scholarly digital
               edition is a remarkable accomplishment for the qualitative and quantitative data
               generated from the written material, but there is much material from the encounter
               still unrepresented, particularly the performative elements of the casebooks. One
               example is the astrological chart, which is not reconstructed in any fashion in the
               transcriptions. Without presenting or representing the original charts, a key part of
               the casebooks’ essence would surely be lost if users only encountered the casebooks
               through the transcription, divorced from the page of the journal. Extra-textual
               encounters with patients are another example of unrepresented material. When asked in
               February about both these points, Kassell replied that while software developers can
               accurately use software to generate astrological charts, they are not always true to
               the charts in the book as Forman drew them, and that she believed the video game in
               development would capture the performative nature of astrological readings better
               than the site could. She further suggested that there is current ongoing effort to
               ‘encode reported speech’ and to record social encounters outside of the case. While
               this is exciting, as of this review those elements are not currently searchable. I
               also wish that metadata pertaining to the materiality of the text and elements of the
               writing itself—other than the location of the case within the volumes—were
               searchable, since their materiality clearly played a role in shaping the encounter
               and giving the astrologers authority.<note xml:id="ftn16">Kassell states, for
                  example, ‘Treating casebooks as found objects highlights how medical practitioners
                  used writing as a tool for marking details or constructing narratives…the format
                  of the notebook…should vary depending on the case…placing each casebook requires
                  attention to the level of learning of the author, format of the paper, layout of
                  the page, ordering of the records, and whether the script is rough or fair’ (2014,
                  615).</note>
            </p>
            <p xml:id="p33">One can imagine how this project could evolve to study other samples of
               early modern medical writing, such as the many examples of <emph>observationes</emph>
               described by Pomata. This development could be used not only to generate local
               historical data, but broad, internationally-oriented information about humanist
               networks, circulation of medical information, and similarities and differences in
               medical and astrological practice across the continent. The ability to track cases,
               many of which were collected and recycled in various publications of
                  <emph>observationes </emph>and casebooks in the late 17th-century, could offer
               insight into the history of reading and the history of publishing. The unique focus
               on the <emph>case</emph> also lends this type of project to adaptation for legal and
               other medical projects across many different time periods. In the meantime, however,
               this project is a remarkable accomplishment, both for the data it generates and its
               transparency. As it migrates to a new library host and hones its relationship to its
               audience(s), I hope we will continue to better understand the casebooks’ performative
               and material nature, as well as the lives of the patients and practitioners contained
               within them.</p>
