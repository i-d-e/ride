            <p>The <emph>edition humboldt digital</emph> is a publication of the project
                    ‘Travelling Humboldt’ by the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and
                    Humanities. Together with its printed supplement the <emph>edition humboldt
                        printed</emph>, it aims to make the scientific heritage that is relevant to
                    Alexander von Humboldt’s journeys accessible in its entirety based on a digital
                    first approach. Overall, the <emph>edition humboldt digital</emph> excels in
                    exploiting digital techniques and successfully positions itself at the
                    intersection of sciences and humanities. Therefore, it will be discussed in this
                    review whether it could be considered not only as a scholarly digital edition
                    but also as an information platform on Alexander von Humboldt and his work in
                    general. Additionally, by pursuing an open science strategy, the edition also
                    paves the way for future reuse of its data. Altogether, even though some
                    technical issues remain, the <emph>edition humboldt digital</emph> can serve as
                    a role model for other digital scholarly editions. As the edition is a
                    work-in-progress project, this review only takes its fourth version into
                    consideration.</p>

            <head>Introduction</head>
            <p xml:id="p1">Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859) is predominantly known as the
                    celebrated German natural scientist credited with the creation of modern
                    geography. However, characterizing him solely as a natural scientist neglects
                    the diversity of Humboldt’s research interests. During his lifetime, he not only
                    advanced fundamental research in today’s disciplines such as geography, geology,
                    geophysics and biology, but also made essential contributions to the fields of
                    national economics and ethnology. Throughout his life he undertook several
                    expeditions to the then unexplored parts of the world, such as Latin America and
                    Siberia, and returned with diverse and meticulously recorded data and travel
                    journals. Because of this field research, Humboldt was not only held in high
                    esteem by the contemporary scientific community, but also received public
                    attention for making foreign countries and cultures tangible for a broader
                    audience. Hence, from today’s perspective, Alexander von Humboldt is considered
                    a cosmopolitan and transdisciplinary, educated scholar.</p>
            <p xml:id="p2"> The complexity of Alexander von Humboldt’s work is quite remarkable
                    but complicates its scientific reappraisal. Firstly, todays self-evident
                    differentiation among scientific disciplines forms an institutional barrier to a
                    holistic approach to Humboldt’s scientific heritage. Moreover, the vast extent
                    of Humboldt’s written output and the complexity of his notes are further
                    hurdles. Taking this into account, the Academy Project ‘Travelling Humboldt –
                    Science on the Move’ at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and
                    Humanities is the first editorial project that attempts the enormous task of

            <p xml:id="p3"> Conceived as a long-term project with a duration of 18 years and
                    funded by the federal state of Brandenburg and the German Federal Republic,
                    ‘Travelling Humboldt’ can rely on a solid financial base and currently belongs
                    to one of the bigger editorial projects in the German-speaking world. With
                    Ottmar Ette, a Professor of Romance Languages and Comparative Literature, acting
                    as the scholarly director and Tobias Kraft as the editorial director, the
                    project is led by proficient Humboldt specialists, who have been involved in
                    earlier Humboldt projects. They are supported by the mathematician and
                    scientific historian Eberhard Knobloch, who is familiar with Humboldt’s work due
                    to his previous position as the Director of the erstwhile Alexander von Humboldt
                    research center and has proven experience in the field of editing scientific
                    historical sources. All things considered, ‘Traveling Humboldt’ brings together
                    a well-chosen team consisting of scholars from diverse research backgrounds such
                    as history, philology, romance studies, mathematics and digital humanities, and
                    thus fulfills its self-imposed interdisciplinary approach.<note xml:id="ftn1">

            <p xml:id="p4">Notwithstanding the project’s solid financial and scholarly
                    resources, editorial focus still must be set. Thus, the project focusses on the
                    thematic complex of travel which is considered an integral element of Humboldt’s
                    work. The primary objective is to make those parts of Humboldt’s personal papers
                    that are relevant to his travels accessible in their entirety in the form of the
                        <emph>edition humboldt</emph>. In practice, this goal is achieved in three
                    ways: The main focus of the project lies on the publication of Humboldt’s famous
                    travel journals, primarily, those pertaining to his American and
                    Russian-Siberian voyages, which have been purchased by the ‘Berlin State Library
                    – Prussian Cultural Heritage’ in 2015. Secondly, the manuscripts are enhanced by
                    a selection of personal papers that document his travels, such as memoirs,
                    publications, map collections and notes. In this section, the sources come from
                    the ‘Berlin State Library’ and the ‘Jagiellonian Library’ in Krakow and some of
                    them have been previously edited. Considering this fact, the project draws
                    partly on the contents of existing, printed scholarly editions but rearranges
                    them by subtopics, such as ‘scientific travels’ or ‘earth science’. The
                    project’s third thematic focus lies on the correspondence Humboldt maintained
                    with other researchers. Just as Humboldt’s personal papers, the source materials
                    originate from different memory institutions and often have already been edited.
                    Hence, the edition includes unedited material as well as information from
                    preceding and third-party edition projects. However, even though borrowed
                    transcriptions or information are always declared as such, a systematic list of
                    all utilized external resources is missing.<note xml:id="ftn2">

            <p xml:id="p5"> Due to its choice in source material, ‘Travelling Humboldt’ not only
                    has to handle the genuine complexity of Humboldt’s work, but also the diversity
                    of the chosen material. The project attempts to tackle these challenges by using
                    the possibilities that are offered through new Digital Humanities technologies.
                    In other words, it uses a digital first approach for its edition.</p>

            <p xml:id="p6">In practice, using a digital first approach means that the
                        <emph>edition humboldt</emph> is developed as a text corpus based on
                    TEI-XML. But why do they call it a ‘digital first approach’ and not simply
                    ‘digital approach’?<note xml:id="ftn3">cf. Kraft 2018a 387.</note> This slight
                    distinction is due to the project’s form of publication: despite its digital
                    methodology, it pursues a hybrid way of publishing. Hence, the XML-based text
                    corpus serves as a basis for both, the <emph>edition humboldt digital</emph>,
                    which is made available to the public on a homepage, as well as the
                        <emph>edition humboldt print</emph>, which is published as a multivolume
                    printed work.</p>
            <p xml:id="p7">Although the project ‘Travelling Humboldt’ focuses on the topic of
                    travel, neither the <emph>edition humboldt</emph> in general, nor the

                        print</emph> have any obvious nominal relation to that theme. Instead, the
                    use of the adjectives ‘digital’ and ‘print’ suggests that the editions define
                    themselves by their chosen medium (see also the <ref type="crossref" target="#div4">chapter “Digital – print – hybrid?”</ref>). </p>

                    of Digital Humanities technologies in order to make Humboldt’s work accessible
                    and exploitable in numerous ways. Both a critical text and a reading version are
                    offered, enabling the reader to comprehend the contextual layer in a compact way
                    on the one hand and conceive the complexity of the sources on the other.
                    Furthermore, both text editions implement intelligent usage functions of
                    authority file-based web services, as the edition is connected to different
                    linked open data platforms. For example, indexing is conducted through the
                    entity data service of the German National Library. In addition, services like
                    ‘Geonames’, ‘Wikimedia commons’ or ‘correspSearch’ are implemented.</p>
            <p xml:id="p9"> Apart from edited text, the edition also provides additional
                    materials such as a bibliography, research contributions and commentaries on the
                    manuscripts. Furthermore, it contains a chronology of Humboldt’s most important
                    biographical data based on an out-of-stock book, which was first published in
                    the 1960s and reprinted in the 1980s by the <emph>Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of

                    omissions and erroneous leaps in chronology in order to recreate Humboldt’s

            <head>Digital – print – hybrid?</head>
            <p xml:id="p13">There are several controversial issues about making a print edition
                    based on a digital approach, whilst simultaneously publishing a digital edition.
                    First, referring to Patrick Sahle, who states that a digital scholarly edition
                    is characterized by its underlying digital paradigm, one might ask whether a
                    print edition based on a digital paradigm is an antithesis in and of
                        itself.<note xml:id="ftn9">cf. Sahle 2017.</note> This argument is supported
                    by the fact, that a conversion of a digital edition into a print edition
                    necessarily results in a loss of information, such as function or metadata.
                    Finally, considering practical issues, it is questionable whether a reproduction
                    of Humboldt’s itineraries (as planned for the printed edition) could not have
                    been realized – or are <emph>already</emph> partly prepared (e.g. through the
                    chronology and the usage of authority files for place names) – in a digital way
                    as well. </p>
            <p xml:id="p14">Regarding this digital – print controversy, it must be pointed out
                    that neither the decision to develop hybrid publishing, nor the design of the
                    digital strategy or anything else within the project in general was done
                    arbitrarily. In that respect, several strategic papers have been published since
                    the launch of the project and accurately predefine and outline the editions
                    mission and methods. In his article ‘Hybride Edition und analoges Erbe’ Tobias
                    Kraft provides an extensive and thorough self-reflection on several
                    controversial arguments for and against digital as well as print editions.
                    Overall, Kraft – who is a media scholar– emphasizes several advantages
                    supporting a print edition, such as better velocity and quality of reading
                    capacity as well as digital preservation issues. However, the latter argument
                    seems to be disputable. Due to the long-term duration and solid financing of the
                    project, the <emph>edition humboldt</emph> is in a unique situation as it could
                    keep up to technical innovations. In doing so, it could also make major
                    contributions towards the research in the field of digital preservation of
                    digital scholarly editions by assessing and evaluating its preservation strategy
                    in the long run.</p>
            <p xml:id="p15">In any case, Kraft is also aware of the aforementioned dissent.
                    Concerning technical matters, he argues that scholarly editions have reached a
                    historical turning point where methodology, technology and media are still
                    dynamic and future developments are not yet in sight. Therefore, he considers a
                    hybrid approach to be the best strategy at the present time. However, this does
                    not mean that the project’s hybrid approach is cast in stone until 2033, as he
                    states: <cit>

                        Therefore, the <emph>edition humboldt digital</emph> meets the transparency
                        criteria as demanded of scholarly editions. Unfortunately, the documentation
                        is only available in German, while most of the other parts of the edition
                        are provided in English as well. Referring to this, consistency would be
                        preferable regarding an international audience. However, as most of
                        Humboldt’s work itself is written in German too, this issue seems to be
                        negligible. Nevertheless, it is worth discussing the edition’s
                        methodological principles in detail for an English-speaking audience at this
                            point.<note xml:id="ftn12">

               <p xml:id="p17">The current guidelines of the <emph>edition humboldt
                            digital</emph> are a beta-version and give a brief overview of encoding
                        and transcription principles as well as data modelling and technical basics.
                        In an introductory section it is outlined that the edition relies on a
                        visual-, text- and content-based approach. Therefore, builds upon an
                        integrative understanding of text. However, the descriptions do not stop
                        there: The project provides a comprehensive comment not only on the
                        different models themselves but also on the resulting practical editorial
                        decisions.</p>
               <p xml:id="p18">Referring to Humboldt’s complex manner of taking notes, an
                        integrative approach is probably the only way in order to handle his work.
                        From data deriving from glaciological measurements and biodiversity studies,
                        to ethnological and socio-historical documentations: The edited data not
                        only is heterogeneous in its nature, but also has a complex structure.
                        Moreover, the different disciplines have different requirements to data. For
                        example, geographers might be satisfied with a reading text, as they only
                        want to analyze Humboldt’s primary data. In contrast, philologists require
                        annotated transcriptions for their research. By using an integrative
                        approach, the edition can serve all these differing scholarly needs. In
                        addition, the edition also achieves basic research itself by using a
                        content-based concept of text. Due to its well-developed content-based
                        indexing, information and entities as mentioned in Humboldt’s notes, are
                        contextualized and brought together with external web services in order to
                        facilitate access to the edition’s content for scholars from all
                        backgrounds.</p>
               <p xml:id="p19">Based on this general methodological introduction, the
                        documentation provides a separate section with further information on the
                        individual treatment of metadata, text, letters and the index.<note xml:id="ftn13">

                        In each section, the practical implementation of the different models is
                        illustrated by using practical examples. On a technical level, the markup
                        system relies on the ‘Basisformat des Deutschen Textarchivs (DTABf)’, which
                        conforms to the TEI guidelines.<note xml:id="ftn14">

                        Therefore, the edition’s data model complies with current standards in text
                        markup and textual archiving. Due to some particularities of Humboldt’s
                        notes, a project-related adaptation and enhancement of the tag set was
                        necessary. For example, a specific tag set in order to describe Humboldt’s
                        measurement data was developed. However, individual adaptations of the
                        schema are well-documented and made transparent.</p>
               <p xml:id="p20">Examining the tagging and editorial guidelines as given in the
                        documentation more closely, each editorial decision is explained in detail
                        as follows: First, the ‘ediarum.BASE’ and their specific implementation in
                        the <emph>edition humboldt digital</emph> are outlined and practical
                        examples of application are used in order to illustrate issues as given in
                        the source and specifically designed editorial solutions. Usually, an image
                        of a text passage, its accompanying encoding as well as its final
                        representation within the <emph>edition humboldt digital</emph> is provided.
                        Secondly, the encoding is explained in detail and all the applied tag sets
                        are listed. Finally, references are made to the documentation of the
                            DTABf.<note xml:id="ftn15">Some examples of application in the
                            documentation also contain practical advices on how to apply the
                            encoding itself. Therefore, one might conclude that the documentation is
                            also designed as internal guideline for the project’s staff.</note>
               </p>
               <p xml:id="p21">Overall, the project’s documentation is a powerful resource that
                        enables users to develop a deeper understanding of the edition. Thus, as
                        already discussed above, an English translation of the documentation would
                        be desirable.</p>
               <p xml:id="p22">Altogether, the <emph>edition humboldt digital</emph>
                        illustrates its complex editorial and methodological decisions in a concise
                        and comprehensive way. This aspect can be traced back to the fact that the
                        entire documentation manages to go into detail without overwhelming the user
                        with too many specific and technical terms. Therefore, the documentation is
                        also easily accessible for disciplines who have little or no connection to
                        digital scholarly editing and achieves to reach a wide group of users in
                        order to allow an interdisciplinary re-examination of Humboldt’s work. Thus,
                        the <emph>edition humboldt digital</emph> successfully positions itself at
                        the intersection of science and humanities.</p>

                        well-structured and easy to navigate. Based on a grid structure, main
                        resources are always provided at the top, while further information is
                        offered below. On the front page of the digital edition, the main resources
                        are made accessible via a navigation bar.</p>
               <p xml:id="p26"> By clicking on the desired menu item, a new layer opens, and
                        the respective contents are also modularly presented by means of a grid
                        structure. Each module comprises a title, a brief teaser text, and most
                        often an image. However, the arrangement of the modules varies among the
                        different sections of the digital edition. </p>
               <p xml:id="p27">For instance, the front page of the section <emph>Topics</emph>
                        provides a kind of main menu, where the elaborated topics are selectable
                        (see <ref type="crossref" target="#img3">figure 3</ref>). By choosing one
                        topic, another sub-layer with different subheadings appears. </p>

                            <emph>Topics</emph> is neat and easy to understand, the presentation and
                        accessibility of contents tend to be confusing in other parts of the
                        edition. For instance, the section <emph>Travel Journals</emph> is displayed
                        on one layer as all the journals and their editorial comments are listed one
                        by one. This vertical and one-level arrangement of information leads to
                        quite a lot of scrolling as all its modules cannot be displayed together in
                        an above-the-fold position. As a result, the arrangement of the journal
                        section rather tends to be a stringing together of various bits of
                        information and therefore makes it difficult for the user to visually
                        conceive the interrelatedness of its contents. </p>

                  </figure> This deficiency of the journal section is further aggravated by
                        the fact that the modules have imprecise titles. Every edited journal is
                        named after its original title, which sometimes leads to obscure headings
                        such as ‘<emph>Voyage d’Espagne aux Canaries et à Cumaná Obs. astron. de
                            Juin à Oct. 1799</emph>’ which labels the edition of Humboldt’s American
                        journal. This choice of title is legitimate, as the content of the module is
                        further specified in the subheadings. However, processing information
                        becomes difficult in general, if not only the editions but also their
                        editorial comments do not have self-evident titles either. Referring to the
                        example of the American journal once again, the title ‘<emph>Ich habe es mir
                            zur Pflicht gemacht, alle angegebenen Beobachtungen ohne Auswahl in mein
                            Tagebuch einzutragen</emph>’ is a literary masterpiece (see <ref type="crossref" target="#img5">figure 5</ref>). Nevertheless, a title
                        such as ‘Foreword’ or ‘Introduction’ would be more meaningful, as it clearly
                        describes the essence of the contributing module. In addition, titles, which
                        are based on multilingual quotations, are inconvenient for an international
                        audience. Even though some modules do have self-evident titles, all in all,
                        a standard procedure for name-assignment is missing and makes the journal
                        section quite confusing. </p>

                        representation in multiple, nested layers (as in <emph>Topics</emph>) would
                        be suitable for the section <emph>Travel Journals</emph> as well.
                        Furthermore, a visual distinction between the edition and its comments

                  </figure> In the following paragraph, the focus lies on the presentation of
                        the edited text itself. As previously described, the <emph>edition humboldt
                            digital</emph> offers a ‘critical text’ and a ‘reading version’ as well
                        as facsimiles. Even though the terminology ‘reading version’ might suggest
                        that it is easier to interpret than the ‘critical text’, this is usually not
                        the case due to the complex nature of Humboldt’s notes. Nevertheless, it
                        needs to be pointed out that the <emph>edition humboldt digital</emph>
                        accomplishes an incredible editorial feat by offering text-critical
                        commentary and indexing (see <ref type="crossref" target="#img6">figure
                            6</ref>).</p>
               <p xml:id="p32">However, from a user’s perspective there are still some
                        practical obstacles to be tackled. Due to the aforementioned complexity of
                        Humboldt’s notes, it is not only difficult to interpret passages, but also
                        to locate them within the facsimile. In other words, a link between text and
                        image would be a tremendous help. Here, the <emph>edition humboldt
                            digital</emph> could exploit further technical options to its
                            advantage.<note xml:id="ftn17">For example, when viewing the first

                  </figure> However, even if a link between text and image was provided, it
                        would not be effective due to another technical issue: text and image often
                        cannot be displayed side by side. For example, some transcriptions are too
                        long to display them in ‘above-the-fold position’, rendering them
                        out-of-sync with the facsimile, as illustrated in <ref type="crossref" target="#img7">figure 7</ref>. Consequently, the high-resolution
                        facsimiles often can only be used with limitations, due to this
                        user-unfriendly integration of the images. As a result, they rather serve as
                        an illustration than as an integral component of the edition. </p>

                        directly accessible via the top-bar. At this point it needs to be

                        content has already been edited or created elsewhere. Therefore, it is not
                        only a collection of terms used within the source collection, but rather an
                        information platform providing broader knowledge. This offers the users an
                        extremely powerful instrument in order to accurately explore Humboldt’s work

                        are provided. They are accompanied by a bibliography which comprises
                        contemporary works from the eighteenth century up to current secondary
                        literature. Within the bibliography, each entry contains a link to a Zotero
                        group called ‘AvH-R’. This group is open to the public and collects
                        literature regarding Alexander von Humboldt on a collaborative basis. Like
                        the indices, the bibliography is browsable too. However, its search function
                        and the presentation of search results could still be further improved. As
                        search results are stringed together and lacking proper spacing, it is
                        difficult to differentiate singular entries. Referring to this, a more
                        user-friendly presentation would be desirable.</p>

                            digital</emph> also offers some exceptional features. Since Humboldt
                        took notes following a specific system, some parts of his manuscripts are
                        not self-explanatory. Therefore, the edition contains a complete breakdown
                        of ‘Humboldt’s Tokens’ (German: “Siglen”), including individual shorthand
                        symbols as well as textual abbreviations, which are essential in order to
                        reappraise his work. Additionally, since the realization of Version 4, the
                        edition also comprises a plant index which lists each plant mentioned in the
                        edited sources and links it to digital databases such as the <emph>Catalogue
                            of Life</emph> or the <emph>Biodiversity Heritage Library</emph>.<note xml:id="ftn18">

                        Hence, this index is a powerful resource, particularly for those from a

                                despite its complexity.</head>
                  </figure> Even though the index section provides a wide range of
                        information, its search function still shows some shortcomings as it might
                        not always deliver concrete results depending on the keywords used. To
                        remedy this, an additional, advanced search engine which scans the whole
                        edition’s text for any keywords is provided (see <ref type="crossref" target="#img9">figure 9</ref>). However, it requires a structured
                        approach and is only useful if one already knows what to look for, as no
                        auto-suggestion function is available. Nevertheless, thanks to provided tips
                        on searching strategies, the search function is easily manageable.</p>
               <p xml:id="p38">For instance, one can select different parts of the edition in
                        order to browse them with one or more terms at the same time. Furthermore,
                        one can carry out flexible queries and for the letter section even a
                        lemma-based search is available. As previously stated, the advanced search
                        engine is preferable to a general search function, despite its complexity.
                        Therefore, it is acceptable that depending on the chosen term it
                        occasionally can take quite some time to retrieve the requested
                        information.</p>

               <head>Future developments and re-usability</head>
               <p xml:id="p39">Finally, it is necessary to take a brief look at the edition’s
                        own positioning within the scientific community. In the course of this
                        review, it has been outlined that the philosophy of the <emph>edition
                            humboldt digital</emph> can be determined by three core elements: open
                        standards, transparency and the cross-linking of information. These goals
                        are put to practice through an open science strategy. The aforementioned
                        openness to future technical and methodological changes as well as the
                        willingness to react to users’ needs by encouraging feedback further enhance
                        the project’s open mindset. Finally, not only the edition’s implementation
                        of open standards but also its willingness to share data is to emphasize. </p>
               <p xml:id="p40">As already mentioned, on the one hand the edition implements
                        secondary information from external services. On the other, it also makes
                        its data and information available to others: For each edited document, the
                        respective TEI-XML file is provided as a free download under an
                        “Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International”- Creative Commons license.
                        Therefore, the edition’s data is almost unlimitedly available for further
                        research, for which suggested citations and canonical references are
                        provided too. Even if there is currently no possibility to download the
                        complete data set, a harvesting function is provided through several APIs.
                        For all APIs, detailed descriptions and the necessary links are listed in
                        the documentary section. Consequently, the conditions of data reuse as well
                        as the download possibilities are designed in a user-friendly way.</p>
               <p xml:id="p41">As parts of the edition might also be interesting for people who
                        are yet unaware of its existence, the edition also collects its
                        correspondence datasets in the web service ‘correspSearch’. Thus, the
                            <emph>edition humboldt digital</emph> follows a sustainable data
                        management strategy from a scientific and technical perspective.</p>
               <p xml:id="p42">Overall, the project fulfills its aim to make Humboldt’s work
                        accessible. Moreover, it not only reaches the scientific community but also
                        inspires a broader, non-scientific audience to engage with Alexander von
                        Humboldt’s scientific heritage by running further outreach activities. As an
                        additional service, the edition runs a Twitter account called ‘Alex von
                        Humboldt’ and regularly posts entries from the chronology section.<note xml:id="ftn19">The Twitter account @AvHChrono is accessible here: <ref target="http://web.archive.org/web/20190604160728/https://twitter.com/AvHChrono?lang=de">http://web.archive.org/web/20190604160728/https://twitter.com/AvHChrono?lang=de</ref>.</note>
                        As 2019 marks the 250th anniversary of Humboldt’s birth, several projects
                        are using the hashtag <emph>#AvH250</emph> in order to draw attention to
                        their scholarly activities. The <emph>edition humboldt</emph> is
                        participating in the anniversary celebrations and therefore links the
                        hashtag, as well as other Humboldt projects of the Berlin-Brandenburg
                        Academy of Sciences and Humanities, to its start page. Thus, it also
                        promotes the presence of partner projects online and therefore pursues a
                        kind of scientific public relations work. Altogether, this effort already
                        bears fruit as evidenced by the huge number of articles about the
                            <emph>edition humboldt</emph> which have been published in the daily
                        newspapers since its launch. Additionally, the fact the <emph>edition
                            humboldt digital</emph> was awarded with the first Berlin DH price in
                        2017 further contributed towards its public and media attention.<note xml:id="ftn20">

            <head>Conclusion</head>
            <p xml:id="p43">Despite the complexity of Humboldt’s scientific heritage, it has
                    been made clear in this review that the <emph>edition humboldt digital</emph> is
                    doing a brilliant job so far. Particularly its exceptional documentation, its
                    user-friendly attitude and the implementation of established technical standards
                    need to be emphasized once again. Referring to this, the edition can serve as a
                    role model for further digital scholarly editions. Due to its long-term
                    duration, it tends to be likely that the project might eventually shape further
                    methodological developments in the field of digital scholarly editions and set
                    new standards in the years ahead. In this respect, the development and
                    presentation of a convincing concept for the long term preservation and
                    accessibility of the digital edition could make a valuable contribution towards
                    the research on digital scholarly editions in general. </p>
            <p xml:id="p44">Concerning issues of digital preservation, one might question
                    whether a reconstruction of Humboldt’s original itineraries necessarily requires
                    a print medium or could also be done in a digital way. Even though Tobias Kraft
                    provides plausible arguments against a digital edition based on reading
                    comprehension and long-term preservation, he does not give any justification for
                    the benefit of an analogue reconstruction of the itineraries at any point.
                    However, as the printed edition is not published yet, its advantages and
                    disadvantages cannot be reviewed at this point. Notwithstanding this, it is
                    already now debatable, whether itineraries that integrate spatial and temporal
                    information can be better presented in the rather ‘static’ print medium than in
                    the digital medium that can render such information in a dynamic and
                    contextualizing manner. Especially the spatial dimension of Humboldt’s
                    manuscripts could be reconstructed in a digital way. For instance, a
                    visualization of Humboldt’s travel route in the form of a map would be an
                    enrichment for the edition. Moreover, such an application would not only be
                    consistent with the topic of travelling but also suits the project’s philosophy
                    of making use of the various possibilities of digital technology.</p>
            <p xml:id="p45">When comparing the edition’s objectives and guidelines with its
                    current condition, it can be concluded that it lives up to its promises. It
                    performs superbly in its self-positioning at the intersection of science and
                    humanities, while also enabling low-threshold access to Humboldt’s work by
                    offering extensive annotations and cross-linking to further material. One might
                    even consider the <emph>edition humboldt digital</emph> an information platform
                    rather than ‘just’ a scholarly edition, as it not only includes edited primary
                    data but also a plethora of secondary material referring to Alexander von
                    Humboldt and his work in general. Consequently, it can also serve other
                    questions of research besides the topic of travelling.</p>
            <p xml:id="p46">Perhaps, the <emph>edition humboldt digital</emph> could also pool
                    scholarly resources by providing a platform for future editions of Humboldt’s
                    work. The quite general naming of the edition itself might eventually lend
                    itself to future re-interpretations or shifts in focus.</p>
            <p xml:id="p47">Finally, it can be concluded that even though some – mainly
                    technical – deficiencies have been identified in this review one can be excited
                    about future versions of the <emph>edition humboldt digital</emph>. As the
                    edition is still in its early stage, further modifications and innovations by
                    2033 are very likely. Indeed, the remarkable feature of the plant index, as
                    released in version four, is a promising indicator for that and gives rise to
                    high expectations.</p>
