            <p>Jeffrey Witt’s edition of the lectures on Peter Lombard’s Sentences by Peter Plaoul
               (1353–1415) uses ‘progressive publication’ to make the text public much sooner than
               has been previously feasible within traditional print models, bringing many long-held
               scholarly ideals to fulfilment. It is centred on a series of documentary
               transcriptions linked to manuscript facsimiles, which are combined into a single
               critical text. This is part of Witt’s broader initiative to create a
                  ‘<emph>Sentences</emph> Commentary Text Archive’ that seeks to facilitate
               comparison of the many commentaries written on this work.</p>

            <head>Introduction</head>
            <p xml:id="p1">Many significant works of the Middle Ages are still available only in
               manuscript form. To read these texts, one must be a skilled Latinist and
               palaeographer, negotiate with a library to gain access to manuscripts, and have the
               leisure to work through various scribal errors. They almost entirely
               inaccessible.</p>
            <p xml:id="p2">This problem is evident in the case of the commentaries on Peter
               Lombard’s Sentences, which organizes biblical and patristic <emph>sententiae</emph>
               (opinions) into a systematic overview of key debates in theology, becoming the
               prevailing textbook on the subject in Western Europe after its creation in the middle
               of the 12th century. From the 13th century until the end of the Middle Ages, it was a
               standard requirement in formal theological study to comment on this book.
                  <emph>Sentences</emph> commentaries survive from many of the most influential
               philosophers and theologians of the late medieval period, such as Alexander of Hales,
               Thomas Aquinas, and Martin Luther; and there are many more from figures who are much
               less known. By studying these texts in the context of the others written, one can
               essentially map the history of Western thought on any of the subjects they address
               (as shown, for example, by Rosemann 2007). Every commentary forms one piece of an
               enormous network, and if we could see and link every part, we would have a much
               clearer idea of the origin and development of philosophical, theological, and social
               ideas in this period.</p>
            <p xml:id="p3">This is practical on a large scale only if there is already an edition of
               the text, and the slow process of publishing texts under the traditional print model
               inhibits the study of works beyond a limited canon. This has not favoured authors
               such as Peter Plaoul, a major figure of the University of Paris in the late 14th
               century who left little written output, drawing limited attention from modern
               scholars (see Millet 2009). The edition of Peter’s lectures on the
                  <emph>Sentences</emph> by Jeffrey C. Witt combats the author’s obscurity and takes
               on a work that would be intolerably expensive to print, since the complexity of its
               manuscript tradition prevents straightforward resolution into a single collated text.
               What we need instead is a series of documentary editions, and the site is suitably
               labelled <emph>editiones</emph>, in the plural. Witt makes the case that we can only
               meet the future needs for learning about the tradition of <emph>Sentences</emph>
               commentaries by taking advantage of the tools for electronic publishing available to
               us (Witt 2015), and this is the first serious project to consider out how to do this
               in practice.</p>
            <p xml:id="p4">The site is also a brilliant application of the principles of
               ‘progressive publication’ to medieval texts to make Witt’s work public while offering
               solutions to the scholarly concerns that made this methodology untenable in a printed
               format, providing a readable draft of the text that he has emended over time. The
               site has been online since 2011, a time when there were few models for undertaking
               and presenting such work. Witt’s edition is an inspiration for anyone unconvinced of
               the benefits of presenting a medieval text online.</p>

         <div xml:id="div2">
            <head>‘Progressive Publication’</head>
            <p xml:id="p5">Lists of medieval authors and their works (such as Sharpe 1997) are
               littered with announcements of editions that are nowhere to be found, the instigator
               having retired, died, or simply lost interest. A later scholar who takes up the
               project must repeat years of labour. Electronic publishing supplies the means to
               avoid this situation. Witt calls his model for publicly editing Peter’s unpublished
               work ‘progressive publication’ (Witt 2013). This idea has already gained traction in
               the sciences, where it is also called ‘continuous publishing’, but is only slowly
               making its way to the humanities. It is hardly a radical notion as applied to
               scholarly editions, as it brings to fruition long-held aspirations of textual
               critics. The Oxford edition of the Vulgate New Testament, though it began in 1877 and
               was not finished until 1954, produced almost immediate results by publishing versions
               of some of its most important manuscripts in a separate series, ‘Old-Latin Biblical
               Texts’, producing seven volumes between 1883 and 1923 (see Wordsworth 1883). The
               creators of the <emph>Corpus Christianorum</emph> originally proposed to publish
               editions of their texts ‘in rapid succession’ and small print runs to allow the
               series to stay abreast of the latest research ([Dekkers] 1948, 413; cf. Leemans 2003,
               17). With the Internet, this vision can finally be realized, allowing editors to make
               their initial work public without their inevitable oversights haunting them
               forever.</p>
            <p xml:id="p6">The many benefits of this approach likely make its use seem obvious to
               outsiders, but there is little precedent in the humanities for making preliminary
               work public, while many scientific disciplines have practised this for decades. We
               need to be both more forgiving of editors and more vigilant in how we use manuscript
               sources if we wish the model to gain acceptance in the field of scholarly editing.
               Especially when one is dealing with unpublished texts, it takes little effort to
               produce a useful transcription, but a great deal more to produce a
                  <emph>printable</emph> edition. Publishing in-progress work entails a certain
               amount of bravery: one must be prepared to make embarrassing mistakes, of the sort
               that might prompt a reviewer to question the editor’s linguistic capabilities.
               Because of the potential for misunderstanding the process, Witt has positioned the
               site as it stands as a ‘finding aid’ meant to precede a full critical edition (Witt
               2013). He makes public only those sections that he feels have reached a reasonable
               level of accuracy; readers can access the rest of the text only by writing the Witt,
               who issues individual accounts. This approach allows the text to reach those truly
               interested in the work, though it is rather labour-intensive and adds complexity to
               the software. It is an interesting criticism of the general trend favouring processes
               that allow scholarship without human contact, and a helpful middle ground between the
               idealist’s approach of placing everything in the open and the typical strategy of
               making one’s work entirely secret. Nonetheless, one hopes that such precautions will
               soon be unnecessary; it is more user-friendly to warn readers of the text’s status
               clearly, as used by projects such as the <ref target="http://ride.i-d-e.de/issues/issue-2/sga_frankenstein-notebooks/">Shelley-Godwin Archive</ref>.</p>
            <p xml:id="p7">If anyone is reluctant to cite such an edition, it is worth remembering
               that our printed editions are far less reliable than we like to think. For example,
               the influential commentary on the Pauline epistles by Peter Lombard is typically
               cited from the Patrologia Latina; it is rarely noted that this is an error-prone
               reprint of a thinly documented edition from the 16th century (Peter Lombard 1535). It
               is available everywhere online, and is far more accessible to the typical reader than
               even the most accurate manuscript; but like most early-modern editions, its
               relationship to its sources is entirely opaque. Even an imperfect working edition is
               a vast improvement over such texts if it has a documented manuscript basis and
               follows modern techniques – and, crucially, is widely available. Scholars continue to
               make assumptions based on the <emph>Patrologia Latina</emph> and students suffer
               through its inaccurate texts every day – sometimes even where a more recent critical
               edition exists, because that edition is only available in a handful of libraries due
               to its ruinous cost.</p>

            <head>The <emph>Sentences</emph> Commentary Text Archive</head>
            <p xml:id="p8">Making texts available more widely available, sooner, is only part of the
               reason to make a digital edition: another is that print editions simply do not allow
               us to answer the questions we ask of them. The edition of Peter’s work is only the
               beginning of an ambitious plan for a <ref target="http://scta.info">
                  <emph>Sentences</emph> Commentary Text Archive</ref>, which will eventually allow
               precisely the type of comparative study that <emph>Sentences</emph> commentaries
               need. As a basis for this, Witt aims to have <emph>Sentences</emph> commentaries
               digitized to a common standard. In this initial foray, he took on two projects at
               once to make Peter’s work available: the editing of the text itself, and the creation
               of an open-source system used to publish it online, <ref target="http://lombardpress.org">LombardPress</ref>, which he has also used for a
               collaborative edition of Adam Wodeham’s commentary on the <emph>Sentences</emph>
               (Hallamma et al. 2011–13).</p>
            <p xml:id="p9">Given the circumstances of a nascent field, the mere fact that the
               edition has appeared at all in a usable form is something of an achievement. There
               are few people who unite the skills of a philosopher, historian, Latinist,
               palaeographer, and computer scientist: Witt is evidently one of them. His ideas
               address the problems faced by all who wish to create digital editions of texts
               written before the modern era. We have no standards for the publication of medieval
               works, or even expectations for what online editions should record from a manuscript.
               Those who set about to begin a digital edition of a work typically find that while it
               is relatively straightforward to mark up a text using the Text Encoding Initiative
               (TEI) recommendations, displaying the resulting files in a readable format is
               difficult. Because TEI-based projects often develop their own guidelines (in
               choosing, for example, among several competing choices for marking abbreviations),
               they tend not to be compatible with one another, making it difficult to reuse work
               from other scholars. The fact that software to support editions must at present be
               written almost from scratch for each project is one of the reasons why digital
               editions have not become more common. Indeed, it is unlikely that digital editions
               will begin to gain traction until a publisher of extended editions exists that
               supports the use of TEI and manages a stringent peer-review process, as the
               forthcoming <ref target="http://digitallatin.org/">Digital Latin Library</ref>
               intends to do.</p>
            <p xml:id="p10">Witt has made a step towards solving these problems in creating a
               modular system, LombardPress, that he intends to be reusable for other
                  <emph>Sentences</emph> commentaries, and has made it available under the GNU
               General Public Licence. Its documentation is still under development, meaning that it
               is not yet feasible to reapply it to new projects. Further, it relies on software
               that is complex to maintain over the long term (PHP and MySQL). Nonetheless, few of
               the problems he seeks to solve are specific to <emph>Sentences</emph> commentaries,
               and there is much that his work could contribute to communities aiming to create a
               common standard for editing premodern documents (such as EpiDoc, which has expanded
               beyond its original scope of epigraphy). What we now need is a decentralized editing
               platform developing Witt’s model that can be applied to any premodern text and is
               based on the most simple technology available, in combination with centralized
               repositories where sources can be deposited and combined with other works for
               research and reading.</p>

            <p xml:id="p11">Witt presented the original version of the site as a ‘social edition’
               (Witt 2011; inspired by Siemens et al. 2012). The term has not aged well, and Witt
               now omits any mention of it, but it is still a visible influence. One might argue
               that the principles of social editing are merely those of making the best use of
               digital media to improve scholarship and make it more widely known. Witt now frames
               it in this way: <cit>
                  <quote>This site aims to be a stepping stone towards an eventual critical edition
                     of the Sentences commentary of Peter Plaoul. As I have worked on this text,
                     learning more and more about it, both about its length and complexity, it is
                     clear that a supremely polished critical edition of the text is not a
                     one-person job. If it is ever to be completed it will require a team of
                     interested people. But there is a dilemma here. How can people ever become
                     interested in the text if they do not know about its existence or the topics
                     contained within it?</quote>

            <p xml:id="p12">It is not possible to tell how many contributions Witt has received. The
               comments function is streamlined, helpfully noting the version of the text to which
               they were referring, but it is rather dull to comb through lists of minor spelling
               and grammar corrections looking for potentially insightful remarks, and it would be
               better if one could make desired changes to the text directly. The Wikipedia model of
               allowing immediate modification is probably not the ideal of most editors; more
               appropriate to a critical edition directed by a particular editor is the idea of the
               ‘pull request’ popularized by the Git source control management software, which
               allows anyone to change their own copy of a file to read precisely as they think it
               should, then create a proposal explaining their rationale (which the maintainer of
               the original merges into the main version). Both of these models make it clear who
               has contributed to a particular file, which might motivate more readers to
               participate.</p>

               </figure> Also implied in Witt’s model is the ideal of providing the reader with the
               same resources as the editor. Registered users are able to view images corresponding
               to the text of the manuscript, including a feature that allows one to compare a
               transcription (helpfully displayed with the original line breaks) against a
               photograph. This is what allows the responsible publication of a preliminary text: if
               one can view the sources, it is easy to confirm the editor’s reading, eliminating the
               fear that one might be risking one’s reputation by citing a working text.</p>
            <p xml:id="p14">Peter’s <emph>Sentences</emph> commentary is a series of lectures, and
               some of the surviving witnesses are student notes, varying considerably in places
               (Glorieux 1939). The edition has so far taken four of seven manuscripts into account,
               with each source transcribed in full. It is not clear if all witnesses will be
               included in the final version; an explanation of the editorial method, manuscript
               selection criteria, and codicological descriptions have yet to be added.</p>
            <p xml:id="p15">While Witt does not explain his method in these terms, he is essentially
               creating a documentary edition of each of these texts, of a sort advocated by others
               (e.g. Pierazzo 2014; van Dalen-Oskam 2015), with an edited text provided (at least
               notionally) in parallel. It enforces, further, the idea that every historical version
               of a text is the edition of its scribe(s). The manuscripts’ original capitalization
               and punctuation is retained (not always consistently), which can be of great service
               in editing a text for the first time; editors have made many blunders because they
               did not take the time to understand scribal punctuation on its own terms. The
               editions could be made more useful by marking where spelling has been modernized (for
               example, <emph>e</emph> is silently expanded on many occasions to <emph>ae</emph>)
               and abbreviation are expanded, allowing their use for linguistic research, though it
               must be admitted that the standard TEI guidelines for these features are too verbose
               to be usable by editors of heavily abbreviated premodern texts. The approach of
               creating a critical edition founded on a collection of documentary editions is likely
               to be the most useful to future scholars.</p>
            <p xml:id="p16">

               </figure> This idea of <emph>editiones</emph> should be taken further. The focus of
               the site is still an eclectic reader’s version of the commentary with a traditional
               apparatus, and we need to reconsider whether these truly help us to answer our
               research questions. Witt is here doubtless thinking of the demands of readers who
               simply want to look up a text and move on, but this could be done with much less
               work. Such readers are rarely interested in textual variants, and simply want
               something they can understand quickly; it would be less laborious to correct the best
               witness and display this in the default view (using TEI, this could be displayed in
               either a diplomatic or normalized form) than to create an entirely separate critical
               text. There are already many competing methods of punctuating modern editions of
               medieval Latin, and anyone with enough experience to read Peter Plaoul directly could
               also work through a corrected version of the medieval punctuation. If one is truly
               concerned about making the text broadly accessible, this can be achieved even more
               effectively with a vernacular translation. A critical apparatus, in the meantime, can
               never meet the needs of every reader interested in textual variants; its function is
               properly to explain the editor’s rationale for reconstructing the text, and this is
               better achieved with a commentary. Its format has never promoted usability, since it
               is defined entirely by the space constraints imposed by print, and it has not
               improved with a transition to a digital format.</p>
            <p xml:id="p17">Witt has the germ of something much better in a tool that graphically
               shows the variants between any two sources, offering the edited text in parallel with
               the sources. Where we simply need to show the differences between witnesses, this can
               be done more usably and accurately with visual tools. The version of the comparison
               tool available at this writing only allows for comparison of two witnesses, and is
               not clever enough to ignore variants traditionally deemed insignificant (as of
               spelling, punctuation, and capitalization). Once these problems are solved (towards
               which Juxta and CollateX have already made significant progress), this will
               eventually represent a far more accessible alternative to the critical apparatus
               normally printed at the bottom of the page.</p>

               </figure> It is difficult to go from an encoded text to an edition that a

               technically possible rather than focusing on what usable, ending up as a mere
               technology demonstration. Witt does not, however, try to impress readers with his
               technical wizardry; one would never know without investigation, for example, that
               behind the timeline accompanying his engaging biography of Peter is a rigorously

               </figure> The only part of the website that reveals the underlying markup to the
               reader is a feature that displays it under individual paragraph menus; the full files
               are gradually being made available for download as they become more complete. The
               edition is not, however, at the point of being easier to read than a typical printed
               edition. Few digital editions produced to date have placed an emphasis on
               readability, with correspondingly low typographical standards. One quickly becomes
               lost in the text of the main reading screen, and the ‘Paragraph Menu’ links create
               unnecessary clutter.</p>
            <p xml:id="p20">This situation could be easily improved by increasing the type size and
               line spacing, reducing the line length, using typographer’s quotation marks, and
               distinguishing the menu link more clearly from the text (by moving it into to the
               right margin, for example). More still could be done by taking advantage of
               responsive design techniques that now make it a relatively straightforward task to
               make a single website highly usable on desktops, tablets, and phones. This is key for
               allowing a text to be usable in a classroom setting, while commuting, or as a
               reference tool in heated conference debates. Yet reading from paper still carries
               many benefits that screens cannot achieve. As part of LombardPress, Witt has also
               written a program transforming his editions into a printable format (using the
               advanced typesetting capabilities of LaTeX). The focus of creating a digital edition
               of a text should be to publish it in a technology-independent format, meaning that it
               is not tied to either paper or a particular encoding scheme, and Witt shows that this
               can achieved with minimal resources.</p>

               an argument, as well as allowing comparison between disparate witnesses (Witt 2014).
               There is also a simple search interface, amplified by lists of names, titles of
               works, subjects, quotations, and unresolved textual issues (a particularly useful
               innovation). Even many completed editions do not have indices as detailed as

            <p xml:id="p22">Computer interfaces are passing: it seems unlikely that much of the
               software supporting the website will still be functional in another decade, and even
               if it is, it will need to be updated to meet the expectations of future users. For
               any digital edition, it is critical to archive one’s findings in an open and
               well-documented format, as well as deposit them in a repository where other scholars
               might find them. Editors hope that we have a solution to the first problem in the TEI
               guidelines, which is highly structured, and helps editors to achieve independence
               from technology through encouraging to record the meaning of their decisions, while
               most other software focuses on visual appearance. While the latter approach
               represents how we have been trained to encode textual meaning over centuries, it is
               much more subjective and less useful, especially when applying texts to new research
               questions or making writing accessible to users with print disabilities.</p>
            <p xml:id="p23">To fill the need for a reasonably stable referencing system, the
               paragraphs of each section are numbered. This comes with the problem that paragraph
               structure often changes as editions progress, and to mitigate this Witt suggests
               citing the version of the text along with this, which is easy to understand and cite,
               and the site gives a sample citation for each section of the text. The lack of
               persistent identifiers is a more serious concern. Even the URI scheme specifically
               reflects on the site’s PHP coding, with addresses such as
                  <code>petrusplaoul.org/text/textdisplay.php?fs=lectio1</code>. Witt could simplify
               links and make them more stable by rewriting this as
                  <code>petrusplaoul.org/text/lectio1</code>. It might be simpler to encourage the
               use of the folio and line numbers of a significant manuscript.</p>

               traditional practice among editors of basing their work on that of others as much as
               possible; West notes that many editors in his day, to prevent error, sent their
               editions to printers by modifying a copy of an older edition using proofing marks
               rather than produce an entirely new typescript (West 1973, 101–2). In any event, the

               The text of a critical edition is not a copyrightable work in some parts of the
               world, meaning that a critically edited version of a public-domain work is itself in
               the public domain (Margoni and Perry 2011). In the European Union, scholarly editions
               have copyright protection for no more than thirty years (even less as implemented in
               most countries). The Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA) licence is
               more reflective of the historical practice of editing; its use formalizes scholarly

            <head>Conclusion</head>
            <p xml:id="p25">If Witt had decided to follow the safe and entrenched path of producing
               an essentially finished text before publishing it in a printed book, few of us would
               have heard of Peter Plaoul, and we would not be able to read his work on the
                  <emph>Sentences</emph> with ease for years to come. Even then, it would have been
               tied to the particular technology of paper, inhibiting its accessibility and limiting
               its usefulness for research and teaching. Instead, we have an in-progress edition
               whose relationship to its manuscripts is far more clearly documented than a typical
               printed edition, and as it develops, it can benefit from the eyes of many readers,
               rather than having us furtively pencilling corrections into library copies or noting
               them in reviews. Through his work, Witt is gradually removing the many barriers to
               the text, bringing it only a translation away from being entirely accessible to a
               moderately educated audience. This is how we should publish medieval books.</p>
            <p xml:id="p26">Witt’s edition felt like a vision of the future when it first appeared
               in 2011. He has overcome the many layers of technical obscurantism necessary to
               publish a scholarly edition online, and has helped to establish a model that begins
               to practise the theories editors have discussed for decades but have never had the
               means to fulfil. Having succeeded in these things, one desires to be able to read
               more about the thinking and process behind his work, and especially to know more
               about what he has discovered in Peter Plaoul. For now, Witt has already brought to
               light the intellectual side of a remarkable historical figure, giving us another
               glimpse into university teaching in the 14th century and contributing another piece
               of the puzzle that is the history of <emph>Sentences</emph> commentaries.</p>
