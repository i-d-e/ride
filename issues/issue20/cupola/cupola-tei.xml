        <p xml:id="p1"><emph>Santa Maria del Fiore</emph>, the cathedral of Florence, stands as a
          testament to the artistic and architectural achievements of the Italian Renaissance. The
          term <emph>complex of Santa Maria del Fiore</emph> refers not only to the cathedral itself
          but also to the adjacent structures that form an integral part of Florence’s religious and
          civic identity, including the Baptistery of San Giovanni and Giotto’s Bell Tower. At the
          heart of this ensemble is Filippo Brunelleschi’s<note xml:id="ftn1">Filippo Brunelleschi
            was a pioneering figure in the development of Renaissance architecture and engineering.
            His most celebrated accomplishment, the dome of Santa Maria del Fiore cathedral,
            exemplified his forward-thinking approach, incorporating novel construction methods such
            as self-supporting frameworks and innovative bricklaying techniques. His work not only
            reshaped the limits of architectural design but also symbolized the era’s intellectual
            and cultural ideals, influencing generations of architects and designers who followed in
            his footsteps (<ref type="crossref" target="#vasari2001">Vasari 2001</ref>).</note>
          dome, a hallmark of Renaissance architecture and an engineering marvel of its time. This
          groundbreaking landmark achievement redefined the possibilities of architectural design in
          the fifteenth century. Its innovative herringbone brickwork and self-supporting
          construction not only resolved the structural challenges of spanning such a vast space but
          also symbolized the intellectual and artistic ambitions of the Renaissance. The
            <emph>Opera di Santa Maria del Fiore</emph> – founded in the thirteenth century – is the
            institution<note xml:id="ftn2">The institution also manages the Museum of the Opera del
            Duomo, which houses many of the original works from the cathedral and the other
            monuments of the complex.</note> historically responsible for overseeing the cathedral’s
          construction and maintenance. It remains active today, focusing on the preservation,
          restoration, and documentation of the cathedral and its extensive heritage. Its archive
          holds a wealth of records that illuminate the administrative, financial, technical and
          artistic dimensions of the cathedral’s history, offering significant insight into the
          processes that shaped one of the most celebrated monuments of Western architecture (<ref

        <p xml:id="p3">Beyond its archival function, the primary mission of <emph>Gli Anni della
            Cupola</emph> is to provide scholars, historians, and the general public with accessible
          and high-quality digital representations of these records. The scholarly objectives
          include facilitating advanced research, preserving historical materials, and disseminating
          knowledge related to the construction of Brunelleschi’s dome and the wider historical
          context of the period. This mission aligns with broader trends in Digital Humanities,

          Beyond serving as a repository – like traditional archives – it incorporates a rich set of
          annotations, functionalities, and contextual layers that align it more closely with the
          characteristics of an SDE. This dual approach, which combines archival integrity with
          in-depth scholarly analysis, highlights its role as a dynamic research resource and
          reflects the evolving nature of Digital Humanities projects in the digital age (<ref

            digitized records and transcriptions of the SDE. Although the available sources do not
            provide detailed technical specifications, they mention the use of XML, indicating a
            structured data format at its foundation. However, without access to the underlying

              document retrieval, the project includes richly articulated indices of names, places,
              and institutions, as well as analyses of content categorized by topics. Terms found in
              the texts are recorded and grouped into accessible glossaries, and reference tools
              such as document summaries, hypertext links to related sources, and indices of
              documentary and chronological references are provided. Although indexing and analysis
              are carried out in standard modern Italian, they remain faithful to the Latin diction
              of the original texts, preserving their linguistic and historical richness. The
              selection of sources and documents for <emph>Gli Anni della Cupola</emph> follows
              specific criteria aligned with the project’s goal of illuminating the historical
              context and construction process of Brunelleschi’s dome. The chosen timeframe,
              1417–1436, represents a pivotal period in the cathedral’s history, supported by a
              relatively abundant body of documentation. Priority is given to documents that
              illustrate practical, administrative, and artistic aspects of the project, such as
              materials procurement and logistics, labour management, artistic commissions,
              financial transactions, and the Opera’s interactions with civic authorities.</item>

          from the archival collection of its parent institution, Arte della Lana, have not yet been
          included. Given that Arte della Lana played a crucial role in the governance and financial
          oversight of the Opera – such as electing its members, managing budgets, and making
          decisions on sensitive matters – integrating these documents would provide a more

        <p xml:id="p11">The curatorial team acknowledges these omissions in the current corpus and
          justifies them based on the project’s current focus on documents directly related to the
          construction and decoration of Brunelleschi’s dome. Documents concerning broader
          administrative, financial, or legal matters – such as those managed by the Arte della Lana
          – have not yet been fully integrated, as their relevance extends beyond the immediate
          scope of the current edition (<ref target="#haines2002">Haines 2002</ref>). There is hope
          that these additional sources will be incorporated in the future, further enhancing the

          form part of a larger project aimed at documenting the history of the documents related to
          the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, encompassing both the artistic monuments and the
          administrative history of the Opera factory, managed by Arte della Lana. The legacy of
          this ambitious work has continued through the 20th century, with scholars such as Giovanni
          Poggi and Ugo Procacci paving the way for Margaret Haines and the current digital edition
          (see also <ref type="crossref" target="#saalman1980">Saalman 1980</ref>, <ref

        <p xml:id="p13">The project’s modern phase began in 1994, as part of the initiatives marking
          the seventh centenary of the cathedral’s foundation. <emph>Gli anni della Cupola</emph>
          was conceived as a pilot project for a digital edition of the Opera’s archival sources,
          featuring a structured system of indexes designed for guided research. This early phase
          was developed in collaboration with Eugenio Picchi, the creator of the DBT (Textual
          Database) system, at the Institute of Computational Linguistics in Pisa, with advice from
          Umberto Parrini of the Center for Computer Science Research in Cultural Heritage at the
          Scuola Normale of Pisa. This partnership successfully combined DBT’s textual management
          capabilities with a newly designed logical structure for data access, creating an
          immediate and integrated database. The results of this pilot phase were presented to the
          public in 1997 (<ref type="crossref" target="#haines2002">Haines 2002</ref>).</p>
        <p xml:id="p14">Following this pilot experience, the Opera di Santa Maria del Fiore decided
          to support the project’s continuation for the period 1417–1436. The initial goal was to
          create a textual database accessible at the Opera Archive and to produce a CD edition upon
          project completion. However, with the advent of the Internet, the project evolved
          significantly (Haines 2002).</p>
        <p xml:id="p15">As highlighted in the “<ref
            target="https://web.archive.org/web/20250311173746/http://duomo.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/INFO_ENG/Project_description.HTM"
            >Project description</ref>” section of the SDE website, the Internet era led to a
          fruitful collaboration with the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin.
          This partnership has been guided by Jürgen Renn, the director of Berlin Institute, and
          Peter Damerow, a renowned philosopher, mathematician, and educational researcher. Between
          1999 and 2000, science historian Jochen Büttner and programmer Bernd Wischnewski undertook
          the task of transforming ASCII archive files into the SGML-XML format, aiming to ensure
          the long-term stability and online accessibility of the data. To facilitate online
          dissemination, the Max Planck Institute employed cost-effective memory expansion to
          develop extensive HTML pages, compatible with all Internet browsers. Between 2000 and
          early 2001, Büttner, in close collaboration with the Florence editorial team, created a
          static yet functional HTML representation of the edition. The HTML interface presents
          options as lists, menus, and glossaries, guiding researchers through the archive’s
          content. In 2001, the project’s initial Web-release featured approximately 5,000
          documents, hosted on both the Opera del Duomo’s and the Berlin Institute’s servers. The
          digital edition has since undergone numerous revisions, with a major relaunch and last
          update in 2015.</p>
        <p xml:id="p16">Integrating photographic reproductions initially presented challenges due to
          technical limitations and maintenance issues. The editors did not plan to include
          photographic reproductions of the original manuscripts, given the constraints of early
          computing and the legibility issues faced by many codices, exacerbated by severe damage
          from the flood that inundated Florence in 1966. However, solutions for photographic
          integration were developed over time (<ref type="crossref" target="#haines2002">Haines
            2002</ref>): <list rend="numbered">
            <item><emph>1958 microfilms</emph>: Black-and-white microfilms of 19 out of 31 codices
              were found in the archive and digitized. According to the subpage “<ref

                >Information about the image</ref>” on the SDE website, in 1996, the Perugia-based
              PDS company scanned the microfilm, while the Parallelo company in Florence processed
              the images by cropping and separating them into 1,634 individual files. The Opera
              archive’s staff utilized printouts from these reels to supplement visual examination,
              employing ultraviolet lamps to enhance the readability of the most faded
              passages.</item>
            <item><emph>Collaboration with Fachhochschule of Cologne in 1999</emph>: The team from
              the Fachhochschule Department of Conservation of Manuscripts used advanced image
              processing and experimental techniques inspired by police applications to photograph
              and virtually restore damaged codices that lacked previous photographic documentation.
              Concurrently, the existing microfilms were digitized and reformatted for easier
              consultation.</item>

        <p xml:id="p18">As a result of the sustained efforts of all the project’s collaborators, the
          digital edition features a vast textual archive enriched with high-resolution images of
          manuscript folios and their corresponding critical transcriptions. At the core of the
          SDE’s methodology is the treatment of each document as a unique primary source. This
          approach reflects a commitment to a philological and <emph>document-centric</emph>
          editorial approach, emphasizing the physical characteristics and historical context of

          prioritizing fidelity to the original manuscripts by closely replicating the text’s
          physical and linguistic features. As defined by Pierazzo, a diplomatic edition “reproduces
          as many of the characteristics of the original document as the medium permits or as the
          project requires” (<ref type="crossref" target="#pierazzo2011">2011</ref>). In line with
          this principle, the SDE’s transcriptions preserve original spellings, punctuation, and
          abbreviations, even if they deviate from contemporary norms. The textual layout, including
          line breaks and marginalia, is also carefully reproduced, and editorial notes provide
          additional context on variations and amendments without altering the original text itself.
          Transcriptions are based on single witnesses, ensuring a precise and trustworthy
          representation of the source material.</p>

            the Dominican Order of Santa Maria Novella. The work was to be carried out in a church
            in Venice, reflecting the intricate network of artistic commissions of the time.</note>
            (<ref type="crossref" target="#img3">fig. 3</ref>) it can be observed that the digital
          text closely mirrors the source document. It preserves specificities such as the
          abbreviation <emph>Nobiles viri</emph><note xml:id="ftn10">In this context, <emph>Nobiles
              viri</emph> can be expanded to <emph>nobiles viri vel magnates</emph>, which
            translates roughly to “noble men or magnates” or “noblemen”. The phrase is a formal
            designation that refers to a group of individuals who hold noble status or rank, often
            used in medieval and Renaissance documents to address or refer to men of high social
            standing, typically followed by their full titles and family associations (<ref

          of noblemen’s names, each denoted with their full titles and family associations – e.g.,
            <emph>Gualterius Iohannis de Biliottis</emph>, <emph>Tomasius Bartolomei de
            Barbadoris</emph>, and others. The transcription also retains Latin conjunctions and

        <p xml:id="p22">Editorial notes accompanying the transcription further provide insight into
          marginalia and textual amendments. For instance, note 1 identifies the deletion of the
          word <emph>prius</emph>, while note 3 indicates the addition of the phrase <emph>in
            civitate Venetiarum</emph> in the margin. These annotations provide essential context,
          guiding readers through changes made by the scribe or later editors and offering a
          comprehensive view of both the text’s material and historical dimensions. This method
          ensures that users have access to an accurate reproduction of the original text,
          complemented by annotations that illuminate its evolution and the editor’s decisions, thus
          reflecting the SDE’s dedication to preserving and presenting the manuscript’s historical
          integrity.</p>
        <p xml:id="p23">The SDE does not prioritize any manuscript over others; rather, it treats
          all documents with equal importance, reflecting an egalitarian approach. No attempt is
          made to create a preferred or authoritative version of the texts. Instead, the focus is on
          accurately representing the original state and variations of each document.</p>
        <p xml:id="p24">The role of digital images is pivotal in the SDE. As mentioned earlier, the
          photographic images of the records are hosted on the external platform
            <emph>Digilib</emph>, which provides tools for zooming, scaling, and framing images.
          Users can access the images in the SDE via the red “view image” button on any document
          entry page (<ref type="crossref" target="#img4">fig. 4</ref>), which opens the digital
          facsimile (<ref type="crossref" target="#img5">fig. 5</ref>) and allows for a comparison
          of the transcription with the original manuscript. For detailed instructions on using the
          dual-level viewing and image management environment, users should refer to the “Image
          Viewing” section in the “Guide” page of the site.</p>
        <p xml:id="p25">However, users may occasionally encounter broken links to some images within
          the SDE. This issue can occur if specific photographic files are unavailable due to
          technical errors or if there are discrepancies between the image URLs and the files hosted
          on the server. Such broken links can hinder users’ ability to view or compare certain
          manuscript folios. Additionally, server-side errors, such as proxy errors<note

        <p xml:id="p26"><emph>Gli Anni della Cupola</emph> adopts a comprehensive approach to
          textual criticism, combining digital transcriptions, indexing strategies, and editorial
          annotations to deepen users’ engagement with and understanding of its texts. The project
          is designed to support rigorous scholarly analysis and research by providing robust tools
          for navigating and interpreting a vast corpus of historical documents.</p>
        <p xml:id="p27">The SDE’s indexing strategies provide an intricate and multifaceted approach
          to document retrieval, accommodating various research needs by organizing access through
          indices of names, places, institutions, and topics. The principal modes of access,
          available from the left navigation bar, are organized into <emph>two primary
            approaches</emph>: alphabetical indices of full item strings and alphabetical lists of
          single words contained within the items. The <emph>alphabetical indices of full
            strings</emph> include names of people, roles, places, and institutions, allowing users
          to explore documents by complete terms, categorized by the original variety found in the
          documents, including patronymics and role specifications. These indices maintain the
          diversity of names as they appear in the sources, normalized only for spelling. Within
          this framework, the SDE indices enable targeted searches based on key components of name
          strings – surnames, nicknames, and provenances – offering enriched research possibilities
          by isolating these critical elements for direct interrogation. The <emph>alphabetical
            lists of single words</emph> provide access to documents by individual words within the
          names, roles, and places categories, such as all terms present in a name, role or place.
          For instance, places are arranged hierarchically, descending from the main locality (e.g.,
          “Firenze, popolo di San Lorenzo” for the parish of San Lorenzo in Florence), while the
          places of origin for persons are indexed under surnames. The indexing of
            <emph>institutions</emph> also follows this model, allowing searches by full institution
          names or by single words within those names. Additionally, the SDE employs <emph>guided
            research</emph> for more structured queries across <emph>eleven recurring
            categories</emph> – such as normative dispositions, finances, personnel, destinations,
          objects, and materials – each further subdivided to enable nuanced exploration (<ref
            type="crossref" target="#img6">fig. 6</ref>). <figure xml:id="img6">

          </figure>
        </p>
        <p xml:id="p28">This method provides users with hierarchical paths to browse specific texts
          based on source terminology, or to perform word searches within these texts for more
          refined results. The integration of both <emph>guided research</emph> and <emph>word
            search modes</emph> across topics like real estate, iconography, events, transportation,
          and other noteworthy areas of interest, ensures comprehensive access to the Opera’s
          records, facilitating detailed scholarly inquiries by leveraging both structured
          categorizations and diverse research pathways. However, despite these powerful indexing
          strategies, the absence of a search box in the interface significantly limits the
          potential for efficient data retrieval. This limitation is addressed in detail in the
          section “Additional features”.</p>
        <p xml:id="p29">The inclusion of commentary is another essential feature of the project. The
          SDE offers critical insights into the nuances of the manuscripts and their
          interpretations. The commentaries in “Notes” address textual variants, contextualize the
          documents within their historical frameworks, and provide explanations to help users
          navigate the complexities of the texts. Meanwhile, the document summaries, or
            <emph>regesti</emph>, provide concise descriptions of the documents, enhancing the
          accessibility and usability of the archive. These summaries are visualized as complete
          item strings and are arranged alphabetically by the first word, facilitating quick
          identification and navigation. Composed in Italian, they serve as a tool for the rapid
          identification of the basic type and content of individual documents, guiding users
          directly to the original texts for more in-depth analysis. They do not replace the
          documents but rather complement the indexing system by providing a quick reference that
          aids in navigating the extensive collection.</p>

        <head>Data Modelling and Technical Infrastructure</head>
        <p xml:id="p30">The digital edition employs a tailored approach to data modeling, opting to
          deviate from established standards like the TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) Guidelines to
          better address the specific needs of the project. At the project’s inception in 1994,
          technical standards such as XML were not yet available, and the decision was made to
          develop a custom solution, resulting in the creation of the DBT software by Picchi<note
            xml:id="ftn13">The editors mention the DBT database on the “Project description” page of
            the SDE. For more information on the early version of the SDE, see Haines (<ref
              type="crossref" target="#haines2002">2002</ref>).</note> (<ref type="crossref"
            target="#haines2002">Haines 2002</ref>).</p>
        <p xml:id="p31">However, as the development of the SDE progressed, particularly between 1999
          and 2001 when the collaboration with the MPIWG began, the acquired data in ASCII format
          was converted to XML, and an HTML version was published (<ref type="crossref"
            target="#haines2002">Haines 2002</ref>). Despite these advancements and a subsequent
          update in 2015, the project has not integrated with up-to-date best practices. This may be
          due to the unique challenges posed by managing a large and diverse collection of
          historical documents, which vary significantly in legibility, preservation state, and
          format. However, this deviation from standard practices has notable drawbacks. The absence
          of a formal schema, such as an ODD (One Document Does-it-all) file in TEI, means the data
          modelling lacks essential formal documentation, hindering transparency and complicating
          reuse or adaptation by other scholars or projects (<ref type="crossref"
            target="#burnard_bauman2013">Burnard and Bauman 2013</ref>).</p>
        <p xml:id="p32">As a result of these custom decisions, the edition relies on a combination
          of HTML for display and XML for text encoding, integrated with a database management
          system for structuring and managing textual data. While this approach provides flexibility
          to accommodate a wide range of document types, it raises concerns about interoperability
          and long-term digital preservation. The reliance on proprietary formats and bespoke
          solutions limits the edition’s potential to integrate with other SDEs, digital archives,
          and scholarly tools. Additionally, the edition does not follow best practices for image
          delivery, such as the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF), nor does it
          implement principles for sharing machine-readable, interlinked data on the web.</p>
        <p xml:id="p33">In contrast, adopting XML/TEI offers a structured, machine-readable markup
          for textual documents that supports advanced querying, analysis, and cross-referencing.
          This also facilitates integration with the broader ecosystem of semantic web applications,
          enhancing data sharing and linking across platforms. Implementing frameworks such as RDF
          (Resource Description Framework) would allow for the representation of data as a graph,
          making it easier to integrate information from diverse sources and enabling the creation
          of linked open data (LOD), which can be shared across different systems. The adoption of
          LOD standards would ensure long-term sustainability and interoperability by connecting
          data across various platforms and domains.</p>
        <p xml:id="p34">Moreover, implementing standards such as IIIF would greatly improve the
          edition’s image delivery capabilities, supporting high-quality, high-fidelity images,
          which are crucial for digital archives focused on images. The integration of JSON or
          JSON-LD would further align the edition with modern linked open data initiatives,
          providing a lightweight method for structuring data that is compatible with contemporary
          web technologies and allowing for easier integration with other digital resources.</p>
      </div>
      <div xml:id="div7">
        <head>Interface and Usability</head>
        <p xml:id="p35">The website’s layout utilizes a combination of header images, navigation
          bars, and tables to organize the various sections of the project. This organization
          ensures that users can easily access different sections such as “Studies”, “Sources”,
          “Dates”, “Indices”, “Topics”, “Reference”, and “Texts”. The interface is designed to be
          cohesive, although it relies heavily on older web design practices like table-based
          layouts using <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>, and
            <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> elements (<ref type="crossref" target="#img7">fig. 7</ref>).
          Updating the design by adopting modern CSS techniques, such as Flexbox or Grid layouts,
          would allow for more flexible and responsive designs, while semantic HTML5 elements like
            <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, and
            <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> would improve accessibility and search engine optimization.
            <figure xml:id="img7">

            <head type="legend">Sample HTML code from o0202001.128b document entry page (cfr. Note
              5).</head>
          </figure>
        </p>
        <p xml:id="p36">The browsing and search experience on the website could benefit from some
          improvements. The interface lacks the intuitiveness needed for users to navigate
          effectively without prior guidance. For instance, the top horizontal bar does not include
          clear call-to-actions (CTAs), which makes navigation challenging without referring to the
          “Guide” section. Additionally, the absence of a search bar further complicates the
          browsing experience, as users may struggle to locate specific content without a thorough
          understanding of the site’s structure. Another issue is the website’s lack of optimization
          for various devices, suggesting that responsive design techniques were not prioritized at
          the time, even though these practices had become widely adopted by the early 2010s in
          response to the growing need for websites to be compatible with a wider range of screen
          sizes, including smartphones and tablets. This limitation could be addressed by
          incorporating responsive design techniques, such as CSS media queries, to ensure the site
          adapts smoothly to different screen sizes.</p>
        <p xml:id="p37">Moreover, the project does not integrate with social media or external
          virtual channels, limiting opportunities for content sharing and discussion. Adding social
          sharing buttons and integrating APIs from platforms like X would foster user engagement
          and align the project with contemporary trends in Digital Humanities, where social media
          is often used for research dissemination and community interaction.<note xml:id="ftn14"
            >While valuable, social sharing features are a lower priority due to the fragmented
            nature of social media ecosystems and increasingly private sharing habits (e.g., DMs,
            group chats). Alternative dissemination strategies – such as targeted newsletters,
            academic networks (e.g., <ref
              target="https://web.archive.org/web/20250428082015/https://hcommons.org/">Knowledge
              Commons</ref>), or scholarly platforms like <ref
              target="https://web.archive.org/web/20250428083234/https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</ref>
            or <ref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20250428083332/https://osf.io/">Open Science
              Framework</ref> (OSF) – may offer more consistent and effective outreach.</note> The
          absence of such features may be due to the project’s age. Social media integration became
          more widespread in the mid-2010s, with many platforms offering APIs for sharing and
          interaction. However, for a project that predates this trend or was last updated before
          these features became standard, such integrations might not have been considered,
          particularly if the focus was on the academic and archival aspects rather than on broader
          community engagement.</p>
        <p xml:id="p38">The pages of the website are organized systematically, reflecting a
          structured archive that documents different facets of the dome over time. The top
          navigation bar provides language options between Italian and English, with clickable URLs
          that lead to major sections of the archive. However, the use of older HTML attributes,
          such as the <emph>onMouseOver</emph> and <emph>onMouseOut</emph> event handlers for hover
          effects (<ref type="crossref" target="#img8">fig. 8</ref>), makes the code less
          maintainable. These could be improved by utilizing modern CSS techniques like the
            <emph>:hover</emph> pseudo-class, which allows for cleaner, more maintainable code.
            <figure xml:id="img8">
            <graphic

            <head type="legend">Sample HTML code from the website homepage.</head>
          </figure>
        </p>
        <p xml:id="p39">The side navigation panel offers links to project descriptions, supporter
          information, staff and collaborations, help, the image archive, copyright details, and
          contact information. The footer section is functional, providing links to navigate back to
          the top of the page, return to the previous page, access help, contact the project team,
          and return to the home page. However, the placement of the “Home” link at the bottom of
          the page can be somewhat inconvenient, especially when the content is lengthy, requiring
          users to scroll all the way down to access it. For example, a “back to top” button could
          allow users to navigate easily without scrolling. Additionally, these links still rely on
          outdated in-line scripting techniques for hover effects, which could be more efficiently
          handled using CSS to enhance performance, readability, and overall user experience.</p>
        <p xml:id="p40">Furthermore, the web pages include interactive navigation features that
          allow users to explore the indexed entries more easily. Arrow icons function as hyperlinks
          and are embedded within the documents’ entry pages. By clicking these icons, users can
          seamlessly move between related entries, enhancing the ability to view and understand the
          connections and details of each record.</p>
      </div>
      <div xml:id="div8">
        <head>Metadata, Interlinkage, Access to Basic Data</head>
        <p xml:id="p41">The project’s metadata and interlinkage strategies for describing and
          connecting the various components of the digital edition demonstrate both strengths and
          limitations. Metadata plays a crucial role in cataloguing and organizing digital content,
          facilitating discoverability, and enabling connections between related objects within the
          digital archive. In this project, metadata about each document – such as the date,
          summary, source, text, notes, links, and bibliography – is embedded directly within the
          web pages containing record transcriptions. These pages adhere to standard HTML
          declarations but rely heavily on nested tables for structuring content. While this method
          helps preserve the accuracy of the transcriptions, it creates barriers to user interaction
          with the graphical interface, and it deviates from contemporary semantic HTML practices.
          For instance, the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of each page includes titles that
          reference specific documents – e.g., “II 1 86: 49: o0201086.049b” – which aids in
          organizing content within the edition but provides limited opportunities for integration
          and interoperability with external digital systems.</p>
        <p xml:id="p42">A significant limitation, as noted earlier, is the project’s lack of
          adherence to modern metadata standards and advanced technologies like Linked Open Data
          (LOD) and the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF). This aspect
          underscores the need for greater methodological transparency and improved data
          accessibility. Additionally, the project does not offer access to fundamental data formats
          such as XML or JSON, which would enable users to download, manipulate, or repurpose the
          data for further research or digital scholarship. Combined with the reliance on outdated
          HTML and table-based layouts, these shortcomings hinder technical accessibility,
          interoperability, and scholarly reuse. As suggested above, adopting current web standards
          could significantly enhance the project’s scholarly impact.</p>
        <p xml:id="p43">In conclusion, adopting machine-readable metadata standards like
            <emph>Schema.org</emph> or <emph>Dublin Core</emph> would enhance the edition’s
          discoverability, facilitating seamless integration with other digital collections and
          fostering broader collaboration within the Digital Humanities community. The absence of
          formal documentation, retrievable XML encoding or basic data, and compliance with best
          practices for text encoding, metadata, and image delivery limits its interoperability,
          reuse, and long-term sustainability. While the edition offers valuable indices and
          critical transcriptions that support scholarly research, these strengths come at the cost
          of broader data compatibility. Aligning with established standards is essential to
          maximizing both the present and future scholarly impact of the edition.</p>

        <head>Long Term Use</head>
        <p xml:id="p48">Ensuring the longevity of digital projects like <emph>Gli anni della
            Cupola</emph> requires a proactive approach to managing the lifecycle of both software
          and hardware components, as digital environments evolve rapidly. Unlike traditional
          libraries and archives, where physical texts such as printed books and manuscripts can
          endure for decades or even centuries without requiring significant technological upgrades
          – though they still need careful conservation and environmental control to prevent
          deterioration –, digital resources face the constant challenge of obsolescence. While the
          preservation of physical items involves addressing issues like mold, pests, acid
          deterioration, and binding decay, these are generally slower and more predictable
          processes compared to the rapid technological changes that impact digital
          environments.</p>
        <p xml:id="p49">In digital preservation, both platforms and the underlying hardware must be
          regularly updated or replaced to remain functional, creating an ongoing cycle of
          maintenance driven by the fast pace of technological advancement. This continuous need for
          renewal results in significant costs for replacing and upgrading software, hardware, and
          digital storage media. Therefore, digital projects cannot rely on a one-time setup; they
          require a dynamic strategy for maintenance and management over time. Any sustainable plan
          for <emph>Gli anni della Cupola</emph> must account for these factors, including
          provisions for ongoing technical updates, replacements, and migration to newer
          technologies to mitigate the risks of digital decay and obsolescence, such as outdated
          software, data formats, and hardware (<ref type="crossref" target="#alberti2001">Alberti

        <p xml:id="p50">For <emph>Gli Anni della Cupola</emph>, long-term use hinges on the
          collaboration between several key institutions, such as the Max Planck Institute for the
          History of Science (MPIWG), the Institute of Computational Linguistics at the CNR in Pisa,
          the archive of the Opera di Santa Maria del Fiore and funding supports from Regione
          Toscana. These institutions provide a foundation for the project’s curation and
          sustainment. Additionally, the sustainability of the project would benefit from a clear

        <head>Realization of Aims</head>
        <p xml:id="p54"><emph>Gli Anni della Cupola 1417–1436</emph> successfully qualifies as a
          documentary SDE, fulfilling its primary objectives of digitizing texts and providing
          historical insights into the construction of Brunelleschi’s dome. By exceeding the
          limitations of print technology and offering unique digital functionalities, the project
          aligns with Patrick Sahle’s criteria for SDEs (<ref type="crossref" target="#sahle2016"
            >Sahle 2016</ref>). It provides a <emph>critical representation of historic
            documents</emph>, ensuring that the digitized texts are meticulously documented and thus
          authoritative for academic research. The edition utilizes structured digital tools and
          technologies to present both photographic facsimiles and transcriptions of the documents,
          fully embracing the digital paradigm.</p>
        <p xml:id="p55">The project further distinguishes itself through the use of sophisticated
          analytical frameworks, such as <emph>thorough indexing and detailed commentary</emph>,
          offering a multi-layered approach to text exploration. Users can move seamlessly from
          viewing a photographic facsimile of a manuscript, to examining its transcription, to
          engaging with in-depth commentary. This integrated approach overcomes the static nature of
          print and enables dynamic user interaction with the material. As a result, the project
          supports advanced philological research, preserves invaluable historical documents, and
          opens new avenues for scholarly inquiry, making it a comprehensive and valuable digital
