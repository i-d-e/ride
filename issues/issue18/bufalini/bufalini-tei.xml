               <emph>Paolo Bufalini’s Notebook</emph> (from here on PBN) is a critical edition of
               the personal notebook that the Italian politician and intellectual Paolo Bufalini
               held from 1981 to 1991. The edition offers the opportunity to plunge into the flow of
               thoughts of a man of the twentieth century who reflects on philosophy, poetry, and
               politics. The methodical goal of this edition, which is implemented with XML/TEI and
               RDF graphs, is to create an encoding system using Semantic Web technologies, able to
               emphasize the complex network of quotations and annotations that fills the pages. The
               digital edition aims to follow a data-centric paradigm. In this light, PBN is
               connected to authority files and external knowledge bases, such as DBpedia, VIAF, and
               WorldCat, to harness the power of the Linked Open Data universe. This review provides
               the reader with an overview of Paolo Bufalini’s work and the main features of the
               semantic critical edition. Finally, PBN can be evaluated as a decent edition, which
               responds to certain requirements of a digital edition, but not to all, and it still
               lends itself to improvements and new developments.</p>

            <head>Introduction to the author</head>
            <p xml:id="p1">Paolo Bufalini (Rome, 9 September 1915 – Rome, 19 December 2001) was an
               Italian communist partisan, an excellent critical observer of history, and a master
               of alliance politics. Assigned to international relations, he played the role of a
               mediator between the Italian Communist Party (PCI) and the Vatican for many years. He
               was a senator from 1963 to 1992. Bufalini was a Latinist and a translator of Horace.
               He was a humanist before being a politician. His readings and his dedication to
               literature and philosophy, as the content of the notebook shows, saved him from an
               all-encompassing political involvement. The former president of Italy Giorgio
               Napolitano, commemorating Bufalini, his friend and party colleague, remembers him as
               among “le migliori energie delle generazioni dell’antifascismo, della Guerra e della
                  Resistenza”<note xml:id="ftn1">“the best energies of the generations of
                  anti-fascism, War and Resistance” translated by the author of this review. </note>
                  (<ref type="crossref" target="#matteoli2002">Matteoli 2002</ref>, 25). Although he
               is considered one of the most influential personalities in Italian politics of the
               last century, there is no significant documentary footage about him. Aside from the
               monograph curated by Giovanni Matteoli in 2002 and published by Rubbettino Editore
               (see <ref type="crossref" target="#citti2008">Citti 2008</ref>), the PBN appears
               currently the widest editorial project focused on the <emph>red cardinal</emph>, as
               he was nicknamed.</p>

            <p xml:id="p3">After Bufalini’s death, his sons donated his personal notebook (kept from
               1981 to 1991) to FICLIT, where some scholars brought the complex textual dynamics
               that animated the paper to light (see <ref type="crossref" target="#citti2008">Citti
                  2008</ref>, 2). This philological work has been conveyed to the digital edition in
               question, first published in 2019, updated in April 2020, and then again in January
               2021 (current version). Thus, the present review is based on this latter version of
               PBN, but the first draft had as a reference the edition of April 2020. That explains
               why, in the following pages, you will run into some screenshots and images that I
               took from the previous version and that are not retrievable anymore but useful to
               enhance the improvements achieved by the current edition. Today, the original
               manuscript is treasured in Ezio Raimondi Library in Bologna.</p>
            <p xml:id="p4">During the decade 1981–1991 (<ref type="crossref" target="#citti2008">Citti 2008</ref>, 2), Paolo Bufalini kept a private journal, which is the
               expression of an experienced man’s thoughts with a sophisticated intellectual
               tension, who had never stopped studying and expanding his knowledge. The Latin
               classics (including Catullus, Lucretius, Horace, Virgil, etc.), the major figures of
               the Italian literature (Dante, Manzoni, Carducci, Croce, etc.), and the protagonists
               of foreign cultures (Flaubert, Shakespeare, Mann, Tolstoy, etc.) came together on the
               same sheet of paper, inside a unique stream of thought. The notebook contains notes
               in Italian, Latin, and English, with the margins and footer filled with annotations.
               As a result, following the author’s thought process can be difficult at times.</p>

               dealing with topics like pain and faith. At the same time, there are lots of passages

               which lots of data were missing, like the mention of the work done by the Institute
                  <emph>La Permanenza del Classico</emph> (involved in the first design of the

               grasp the meaning of the adopted methodology, the RDF dataset components, the web
               application development, and the possible filters for semantic queries. The choice to
               include on the website technical information not strictly related to the philological
               value of the edition, like the explanation of web application development, unveils a
               didactic vocation, which goes well with the academic environment where the edition is
               born. Although expanding beyond the humanities to include explanations about
               ontologies, metadata, and web technologies is commendable, the lack of information on
               the philological principles utilized, which deserves its own dedicated section, can
               be perceived as a shortcoming. While it is true that different entities
               (specifically, the study center <emph>La Permanenza del Classico</emph>) made the
               editorial decisions, it is also true that Francesca Giovannetti, one of the
               publishers of PBN, was involved in the project’s development from an early stage, as
               she confirms in the passage below. <cit>
                  <quote>The development of the digital edition started with the diplomatic
                     transcription of the text, which preserved all the original characteristics of
                     the writings, such as spelling and punctuation, deletions and additions,
                     abbreviations and line breaks. Subsequently, the centre carried out the
                     encoding of the text in TEI Lite P4. […] In 2013, the centre [“La Permanenza
                     del Classico”] came to the decision of migrating from TEI Lite P4 to TEI P5 and
                     I was charged with this task. […] With the migration from TEI Lite P4 to TEI P5
                     the encoding model has substantially changed: different choices were made for
                     the representation of textual phenomena and of editorial additions. (<ref type="crossref" target="#giovannetti2015">Giovannetti 2015</ref>, 2)</quote>

               section, it would be appropriate to provide more comprehensive information about
               these decisions. However, a close comparative reading between the facsimile and the
               transcription allows an informed user to grasp the philological decisions behind the
               text and its transcription because there are no cases of extreme philological

               The general parameters of the edition, therefore, can be considered partially
               accessible to the final user: the overview of the context, the editors, the mission,

               mind. DSEs can exchange precious knowledge thanks to shared knowledge graphs on the
               Semantic Web. The TEI encoding mediates between the ontologies and the source text,
               and as stated in the ‘XML/TEI Encoding’ section on the PBN ‘Introduction’ page: “It
               aims to represent the relationships between the textual fragments of the notebook
               (citations, comments, translations, etc.) and to link the local authority files to
               external datasets” (<ref type="crossref" target="#daquino_dellobuono_giovannetti_tomas2020">Daquino et al. 2020</ref>).</p>
            <p xml:id="p15">This means that the RDF dataset is populated by the extraction of the
               TEI entities via XSLT, generating a Turtle file from the TEI document, or that it is
               created manually (<ref type="crossref" target="#giovannetti2015">Giovannetti
                  2015</ref>, 30-31). Furthermore, the embedded markup model of the notebook is
               complemented with ontologies that open the door to a ‘global data space’ in which
               URIs identify documents and data they contain (e.g., entities) that could be used in
               many different applications (<ref type="crossref" target="#giovannetti2015">Giovannetti 2015</ref>, 15). The interoperability of the edition achieved through
               the use of Linked Open Data (LOD) is, therefore, the main scholarly contribution. </p>
            <p xml:id="p16">The curators, however, have decided to only share the output – the
               result of this ample reflection behind the creation of the edition – through the
               official site of PBN. On the ‘Home’ page you can read: “The primary aims of the
               edition are to identify, analyse and enhance the intratextual and extratextual
               relations – otherwise implicit, given the private nature of the notebook – which
               characterize the texts of the <emph>Appunti</emph>[...]” (<ref type="crossref" target="#daquino_dellobuono_giovannetti_tomas2020">Daquino et al. 2020</ref>).</p>
            <p xml:id="p17">The essence of their research project is to create a bespoke application
               able to enhance the text. They find the answer to such information needs through the
               Semantic Web technologies, but the brief digression on the ‘Introduction’ page about
               the features and the functioning of the LOD implementation could be deepened and
               explained in a more complete way. The risk, otherwise, is that the user, especially
               if new to LOD, could lose the necessary information to enjoy the edition as a whole.
               According to my experience, the paper by Daquino, Giovannetti, and Tomasi (<ref type="crossref" target="#daquino_giovannetti_tomasi2019">2019</ref>) fills the
               information gap about the strategy to implement the DSE with Semantic Web
               technologies, but I would like to find the explanation of this vision, promoted as
               the strength of the edition in the aforementioned paper, in the official webpage of

               which surely does not compromise the understanding of the text, but it would be
               better to fix it: by accessing the ‘Digital Edition’ section, the box that appears

               exploration of the edition by a reduced screen on a PC distorts the interface, which
               undergoes a loss of information and functions (see <ref type="crossref" target="#img3">Fig. 3</ref>). The horizontal comparison between the
                  <emph>facsimile</emph> and the transcript, for example, is totally hampered by the
               graphic arrangement of the ‘Transcript’ box placed vertically above the ‘Facsimile’
               box. Although a medium-sized screen is generally recommended to use a DSE, and
               therefore, the aforementioned situation cannot be properly defined as a deficiency,
               making the site responsive might be a valuable idea to take into account for a

               </figure>The ‘Filters’ tab, split into ‘People’ and ‘Works’, is a tool to search for
               specific contents in the transcription. The occurrences of the selected person are
               reported in a list of results on top, and they are highlighted in blue in the
               transcription of the notebook. Once a ‘People’ filter is adopted, you can also
               distinguish the results by the ‘Person role’ (‘Author’ or ‘Mentioned person’), as
                  <ref type="crossref" target="#img6">Fig. 6</ref> shows.</p>
            <p xml:id="p26">Concerning the text fruition, when the mouse cursor scrolls on a
               paragraph of a page in the facsimile, a frameset containing some information about
               that text portion (like the author of the quoted text, mentioned entities,
               translations, etc.) shows up on the screen (red circle, <ref type="crossref" target="#img6">Fig. 6</ref>), whereas, clicking on it, the transcript of that
               portion appears on the left. The facsimile and the transcription box, indeed, are
               synchronized: when the user turns over the pages, the transcription automatically
               updates to reach the textual passage the facsimile is showing. Vice versa, by
               scrolling up or down on the transcription tab (that offers a sequential read,
               developed vertically), the facsimile quickly goes on or back to the point considered. </p>
            <p xml:id="p27">This elegant format makes the reading fluid and pleasant. The user does
               not run into the discomfort of having to open other screens to fully enjoy the text
               and its meaning. However, the page layout loses this harmony when you disable the
               full-screen mode of the browser window. </p>

               </figure>The PBN also presents two indices, e.g., the ‘Index of Persons’ and the
               ‘Index of Works’, related to people and works mentioned by Bufalini on his pages. The
               indices are well organized. The user can directly search among ‘People’ and ‘Works’
               thanks to the search bar (circled in red, <ref type="crossref" target="#img7">Fig.
                  7</ref>) or by browsing the list. A legend (on the bottom left, circled in green,
                  <ref type="crossref" target="#img7">Fig. 7</ref>) clarifies the different colors
               assigned to ‘Comments’, ‘Quotations’, and ‘Translations’. The possibility of
               arranging the page is appreciable, as I explained before, but in this case, the
               ‘Filters’ tab is unnecessary because it plays the same role as the ‘List’ of names.
               Besides, even if the user decides to close this box, the ‘Types of excerpts’ (the
               legend) would be closed consequently.</p>

               easy to remember, meaning that the user can easily regain proficiency when returning
               to the site after a period of time; the site should always give the user the
               possibility to fix an error and, finally, its design should be pleasant to use (<ref type="crossref" target="#nielsen2012">Nielsen 2012</ref>). As I stated in the
               previous section, my personal experience as a user of PBN was a positive one, and the

               page of the notebook (because of the correct access to the navigation button) without

            <p xml:id="p34">Even though PBN does not devote a deep explanation to the editing
               principles, it is clear that the transcription made by the editors comes close to a
               diplomatic one. Francesco Citti writes: “all characteristics concerning spelling and
               punctuation, including any eventual errors or incorrect quotations were preserved.
               Particular marks (such as arrows, references, boxes), were reproduced and where this
               was not possible, were described (using notes […]” (<ref target="citti2008">Citti</ref>, 71). Indeed, the transcription philologically reproduces the
               original text, trying to maintain unaltered any passage, but in the digital edition,
               not all the symbols and signs are reproduced in the same way compared to what is
               visible in the facsimile. Some examples are given below.</p>

               passage of the notebook. It is a personal comment of Bufalini, who remembers the
               impressions and emotions felt during the funeral of his friend Luigi Petroselli on
               8th October 1981.</p>
            <p xml:id="p36">The handwriting thins out; it follows the stream of the thoughts and,
               therefore, runs from the hand to the sheet, the line spacing gets smaller, and the
               time of the story is agitated. It has been written in one go. The erasures and second
               thoughts, indeed, have been purposefully kept by the author. The interpretation of
               the passage is undoubtedly difficult because of the unclear handwriting; however, the
               transcription proposed by the PBN wisely reveals the sense of those words.</p>
            <p xml:id="p37">The transcript of the notebook is, therefore, sophisticated, but, as I
               wrote above, there is no documentation of the editing principles. In the
               ‘Philological note’ of the ‘Introduction’ page, we can read:<cit>
                  <quote>The transcription philologically reproduces the original text. However, in
                     the digital edition we did not reproduce the exact symbols and signs used by
                     the author to separate or graphically connect excerpts. Nonetheless, along with
                     the transcription, the edition offers an interactive visualization of
                     facsimiles, so that the reader can retrieve all the details. (<ref type="crossref" target="#daquino_dellobuono_giovannetti_tomas2020">Daquino

            <p xml:id="p38">A further clarification about the philological principles is, instead,
               available in the section <emph>Digital edition: representation and encoding of the

               principles are indeed enclosed in the XML encoding, which expresses the
               interpretation of text fragments curated by the study center <emph>La Permanenza del
                  Classico</emph>. For instance, a markup such as <code>&lt;div2 type="nota"
                  place="margine"&gt;</code> is assigned to a margin note of the notebook, and
                  <code>&lt;hi rend="sottolineato"&gt;</code> is assigned to a graphic element of
               the underlining (<ref type="crossref" target="#citti2008">Citti 2008</ref>, 77). The
               transcription of graphical elements is quite intuitive because of their high
               resemblance with the symbols of the original pages. However, the absence of a legend
               of identified marks with the corresponding meaning is not admissible for a scholarly
               edition. Especially if, like in the example below (<ref type="crossref" target="#img18">Fig. 18</ref> and <ref type="crossref" target="#img19">19</ref>),

               the author is recognizable. Under the erasures, ‘Nitzsche’ can be seen (circled in
               red in <ref type="crossref" target="#img16">Fig. 16</ref> and zoomed in <ref type="crossref" target="#img17">Fig. 17</ref>). Thus, ‘<del>Nitzsche</del>’ could
               be a better solution. Moreover, even if the symbol ⧟ is retraced by Bufalini
               with a red pen both times (p. 24 and p. 25), the editors reproduce it in red only the
               second time (circled in blue and orange, <ref type="crossref" target="#img16">Fig.

               suited for reproducing these circumstances. As stated in the ‘Introduction’ page,

            <head>Conclusion</head>
            <p xml:id="p49">PBN fulfils some of the main requirements that a Scholarly Digital
               Edition should meet: it offers a critical representation of the historical document
               that is Paolo Bufalini’s notebook and it is guided by a digital paradigm. However, it
               lacks a deep philological documentation. Indeed, a potential printed version of this
               edition would lose contents and functionalities detained by the current one. The user
               is invited to interact with the system and to consult its metadata, to access
               reliable sources and a correct transcription, and its editors have the merit of
               sharing a high-value work previously unpublished. Besides, the work done for
               extending the reality of the edition to the Semantic Web environment is what makes
               this digital edition innovative and different from the others available nowadays.
               According to Patrick Sahle’s catalog of Digital Scholarly Edition<note xml:id="ftn22">
                  <ref type="crossref" target="#sahle2008">Sahle 2008-2023</ref>.</note>, indeed,
               among more than 700 cases of studies, only one makes use of Semantic Web
               technologies, and it is burckhardtsource project<note xml:id="ftn23">burckhardtsource
                  project. <ref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20231105093856/https://burckhardtsource.org/">https://burckhardtsource.org/</ref>.</note>, a semantic Digital Library that
               hosts the critical and semantic edition of the letters written to Jacob
               Burckhardt.</p>
            <p xml:id="p50">The decisions that have guided PBN are described, but the lack of
               detailed documentation of the project represents a flaw. Conveying all the
               information about the project (currently spread into different scholarly
                  articles<note xml:id="ftn24">
                  <ref type="crossref" target="#citti2008">Citti 2008</ref> and <ref type="crossref" target="#daquino_giovannetti_tomasi2019">Daquino, Giovannetti, and Tomasi
                     2019</ref>. </note>, mainly written by the same editors) on the PBN page would
               make it a self-sufficient source. </p>
            <p xml:id="p51">Moreover, the notebook also appears very suitable for a critical edition
               with a critical commentary. Thanks to the dates noted by Bufalini at the top of some
               pages, it could be interesting to investigate some possible connections between his
               philosophical reflections and the coeval social and historical context, during which,
               let me stress, Bufalini still served as senator of the Republic. This is just an idea
               that genuinely came to me while leafing through the notebook. Alternatively, another
               suggestion could be to conduct a technical analysis of the various pens<note xml:id="ftn25">Bufalini used black, blue, red, and even green pens. He sometimes
                  took a pencil to underline pieces of text written with the pen. Page 140 of the
                  notebook shows this mixture well. </note> used by the author over ten years, which
               could unveil, for instance, the timing and the meaning of some comments and the
               underlining. So why not think about extending the ambitions and aims of the edition
               to a wider work in the future?</p>
            <p xml:id="p52">Therefore, PBN is a valuable project that achieves a good result in
               terms of visualization of the facsimile, accessibility, and usability; it has a
               modern style that makes the fruition of the site an enjoyable experience and provides
               a well-done transcription of an unpublished work. In conclusion, although the editors
               did not mention further extensions of the edition, I would suggest they deal with
               some of the weaknesses of the edition and fully realize the high potential of
               PBN.</p>
