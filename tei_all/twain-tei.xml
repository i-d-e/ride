            <p>The Mark Twain Project Online (MTPO) provides digital critical editions of Mark
                    Twain’s writings for the purpose of scholarly study. The edition project creates
                    a foundation for in-depth research on Mark Twain’s person and texts, as well as
                    contributes greatly to this research itself. All the editions and resources from
                    the MTPO are available free of cost and without registration. The goal of the
                    edition is to publish all of Mark Twain’s writings and this review concentrates
                    particularly on their digital edition of Mark Twain’s letters. This edition
                    project achieves a great deal of transparency regarding editorial principles and
                    practices, making it easy for the reader to follow the editorial decisions. The
                    amount of scholarly work put into the editing and commentary is commendable and
                    offers a vast amount of information for research and analysis. The technical
                    aspects of the digital edition are satisfactory, providing for a digital edition
                    that is easy to read and use, however does not reach the same level of
                    excellence as the critical text and commentary. Considering however that the
                    MTPO went online over ten years ago, in 2007, its usability has stood the test
                    of time.</p>

               </cit> I was asked to review an online edition of Mark Twain's letters, about
                    which the Great Public has already spoken, one which has been an ongoing success
                    for the past ten years. Despite this fact, and despite Twain’s stance on
                    individual opinions, I was happy to take on the job of delving into the edited
                    text of the Mark Twain Project Online and examining the website, if only because
                    this edition project is unfinished and has many more years of work ahead of it.
                    It is an ever-growing and evolving effort; thus it is hoped that a review even
                    at this stage may shed new light.</p>

               </figure> The Mark Twain Project Online (MTPO) provides digital critical
                    editions of Mark Twain’s writings for the purpose of scholarly study. The
                    edition project creates a foundation for in-depth research on Mark Twain’s
                    person and texts, as well as contributes greatly to this research itself. All
                    the editions and resources from the MTPO are available free of cost and without
                    registration. The project created print editions before going digital in 2007
                    with the launch of MTPO, and today they continue to publish both online and in
                    print. This review will concentrate on the digital edition of Mark Twain’s
                        letters.<note xml:id="ftn4">The full titles and bibliographic information of
                        the eight letter editions can be found on the project’s electronic title

            <p xml:id="p4">The MTPO aims to publish everything that Mark Twain wrote, no small
                    task. On its website Twain’s texts are split into two categories,
                        <emph>Letters</emph> and <emph>Writings</emph>. Under the latter category,
                    five critical editions are available, including his most famous works, <emph>The
                        Adventures of Tom Sawyer</emph> and <emph>Huckleberry Finn</emph>, as well
                    as the long-awaited<emph> Autobiography of Mark Twain</emph>. Under the category
                        <emph>Letters</emph> there are over 2,600 edited letters and about 30,000
                    records of letters (metadata). Considering all that Mark Twain wrote<note xml:id="ftn5">
                  <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain_bibliography">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain_bibliography</ref>. </note>,
                    there still remains much to be edited and published. Under the heading ‘Coming
                    Soon’ one finds the titles <emph>Notebooks &amp; Journals, Volumes 1–3</emph>
                    and <emph>Early Tales &amp; Sketches, Volumes 1–2</emph>. </p>
            <p xml:id="p5">The MTPO has already been reviewed multiple times, by <emph>The New
                        Criterion</emph>, the <emph>Times Literary Supplement</emph>, and many
                        others.<note xml:id="ftn6">

                    the seal of approval from the Modern Language Association. This review will
                    concentrate on the MTPO’s digital collection of Twain’s letters and will focus
                    particularly on the editorial practice and the edition’s characteristics as a
                    digital publication. </p>
            <p xml:id="p6">The archival material, originally bequeathed from Mark Twain to his
                    daughter Clara Clemens Samossoud, came to its current home at the University of
                    California, Berkeley, in 1942 and is now part of an archive entitled The Mark
                    Twain Papers, housed at the University's Bancroft Library. A research team
                    produces the critical editions, which are published by the University of
                    California Press. The first critical print edition was published in 1967, and
                    the first digital edition followed in 2007 with the launch of the MTPO.</p>
            <p xml:id="p7">The project has been funded since 1966 primarily by the National
                    Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), a grant for which they must re-apply every
                    two years, as well as by matching private donations and through other public
                    support (including that of the Bancroft Library itself). The MTPO website states
                    that the amount of private donors must grow in order for the project to
                    continue. It should also be noted that President Donald Trump has attempted to
                    eliminate the NEH<note xml:id="ftn8">

                    </note> and the MTPO is just one of countless projects that would struggle for
                    survival were such a measure enacted.</p>
            <p xml:id="p8">The digital publications have not completely replaced the paper
                    versions, as some of the editions still appear both online and in print. For
                    instance <emph>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</emph> was printed first in 2010 in
                    paper form by the project (three years after the MTPO's inception) and only
                    after this initial print publication was it made available online for the MTPO
                    in 2017. A slightly befuddling aspect of the project is the relationship and
                    differences between the texts online and those in print. It would be helpful if
                    there were a few lines on the website to clarify their correlation. Ideally the
                    connection would be detailed between texts that are a digitized version of
                    editions printed in the past (before MTPO existed), between texts created
                    concurrently for both digital and print publication, and the plan for texts
                    published in the future.</p>
            <p xml:id="p9">Most of the above information for this introduction was found on the

                    </note> Transparency is a key factor that this review will be examining, and
                    easily-accessible project information is an important part of this. The MTPO has
                    clearly made an effort to share details about the project and its history. This
                    review will also examine the transparency of the critical text as well as the
                    digital aspects of the edition. In terms of the critical text this means
                    documentation of the decisions made by the editor, as well as their reasoning
                    behind those decisions. In terms of the digital aspects this means access to
                    encoded texts and an explanation of the technical infrastructure.</p>
            <p xml:id="p10">This review, as mentioned above, examines specifically MTPO’s
                    critical edition of Mark Twain’s letters. In the following section some basic
                    information about the digital collection of letters will be given and the
                    relationship between the print and online editions will be examined.
                    Additionally, the <emph>Guide to Editorial Practice</emph>, which is published
                    on the website as part of the letters edition, will be examined. In order to see
                    the ‘guide’ in action, a letter from the edition will be studied alongside a
                    facsimile of the original. For those researchers not just interested in close
                    readings, but also in more general questions that can be asked of the data, a
                    test search will then be run. Some of the more general resources on the website
                    will be looked at, and finally, there will be comments on the technical aspects
                    of the project.</p>

                        however not linked to their corresponding edited letters. These facsimiles
                        originate from the printed volumes’ section Photographs and Manuscript
                        Facsimiles and are displayed as they are found in that chapter of the

                    </note> Each letter has an ID number and is encoded in TEI-XML. The edited
                    letters date from 1853, when Twain was 17 years old and had recently left home,
                    and reach up until year 1880, when he was 45 and a well-established writer and
                    celebrity. The cataloged letters cover a much wider range of dates and persons,
                    and on the website it states that more edited letters will be added.</p>

            <p xml:id="p12">Before going digital with the launch of MTPO in 2007, six volumes of
                    Mark Twain’s letters had already been published by the project in print form
                    between 1988 and 2002. These six volumes were transformed into TEI-XML and made
                    available online as part of the MTPO. It can be inferred (although an explicit
                    remark from the editors would be helpful) that the letters and accompanying
                    editorial information found in the digital versions does not differ from the
                    print editions, which are still available for purchase. I compared one letter
                    from the printed edition to its digital counterpart and found this (at least in
                    this random sampling), to be true.<note xml:id="ftn11">I compared the print and

                    differences in the digital and print versions. This is, however, based on the
                    assumption that the initial digital publication of the letters contained no
                    significant deviations from the previously printed editions.</p>
            <p xml:id="p15">There are also letters on the website that were not previously

                    collection titled Mark Twain’s Letters Newly Published 1. As both of these are
                    only available online, it would appear that, for the letters at least,
                    everything produced after 2007 is published exclusively on the digital platform
                    and is no longer produced in printed volumes. </p>
            <p xml:id="p16">Interestingly enough, despite originating from different volumes
                    spanning many years, all of the letters on the website are linked to the same

                    will be looked at in detail in the following section. Here it can be noted that
                    it was written by Robert H. Hirst, who is now the general editor of the letters,
                    in 1987<note xml:id="ftn14">This date was not found on the website, but by
                        looking in the first printed volume of the letters (Mark Twain’s Letters,

                    printed volumes and found that each volume, except volume four (which simply
                    refers to the guide in volume three), includes this <emph>Guide to Editorial
                        Practice</emph>. When one compares the content of the guide between the
                    printed volumes one sees that there are differences between the volumes, but
                    nothing substantial—the editorial principles do not change. The 2007 version of
                    the guide mentions digital aspects, different editorial symbols used for the
                    online publication, and so forth, but it remains essentially the same as the
                    original guide published in 1988. This can only be possible with extreme
                    consistency in the editorial practice, despite spanning an extensive time period
                    and multiple editors working on the project. Undoubtedly this is partly due to
                    the fact that Hirst has been part of the project since its foundation. In
                    conclusion it seems indeed unproblematic to have one guide, revised in 2007, for
                    all the letters on the website</p>

                  <bibl>Mark Twain Project Online, Guide to Editorial Practice</bibl>
               </cit> As mentioned above, the <emph>Guide to Editorial Practice</emph> for
                    Twain’s letters was first written in 1987 by Hirst, and has since been the
                    method used for all of Twain’s letters in the edition project. The editorial
                    practice for the letters is explained herein wonderfully and it offers a
                    commendable amount of transparency. The facts that these guidelines are
                    available to the reader, are well-written, and can be found with ease, earns it
                    much praise. The guide is a pleasure to read—no small feat for a text that
                    describes in detail an edition’s editorial philosophy and its practical
                    implications. Here I will look at some of the principles expounded on within the
                    guide and a few detailed examples of the editorial practice as described
                    therein. As the guide is quite long, only a few aspects will be mentioned. The
                    goal is to gain insight into the editorial principles and how they are
                    explained, allowing an evaluation of both and later a more informed evaluation
                    of the edited text. </p>
            <p xml:id="p19">According to the guide, the editors are providing letters which are
                    extremely faithful (‘<emph>maximally faithful</emph>’) to the original
                    handwriting. They write, ‘<emph>We must begin, in fact, with the assumption that
                        almost any aspect of an original letter might be significant, to either the
                        writer or the recipient, or both—not to mention those for whom the letters
                        are now being published</emph>’.<note xml:id="ftn15">‘Guide to Editorial
                        Practice, (MTDP 00005).’ In Mark Twain Project Online. Berkeley, Los

                    </note> Thus the editors strive to emend the text only when absolutely necessary
                    for legibility or intelligibility. The editors exclude in the transcription any
                    deletions or revisions that were made after the letter was already sent and
                    received, even if alterations were made by the original writer or recipient. We
                    will see a practical example of this below with the examination of an actual
                    letter.</p>
            <p xml:id="p20">The editors call the result of their method, i.e. the edited text,
                    ‘plain text’, a term of their own creation. In doing so they wish to
                    differentiate their result from Fredson Bowers ‘clear texts’ and ‘genetic
                        texts’.<note xml:id="ftn16">Fredson Bowers, ‘Transcription of Manuscripts:
                        The Record of Variants’ Studies in Bibliography 29 (1976).</note> Clear
                    texts being those for which textual phenomena are described in the apparatus,
                    and genetic texts being those in which textual phenomena are found represented
                    in the text itself, displayed through editorial symbols (such as a diamond for
                    obscured letters, etc.). ‘Plain text’ aims to be a kind of combination of these
                    two methodologies, with some editorial symbols used in the text as well as some
                    information found in the textual apparatus. This approach should serve the
                    editors’ goals of ‘maximum fidelity’ and ‘maximum legibility’. Exact details of
                    how ‘plain text’ achieves this combined aim is not clearly stated, but
                    presumably it is because through the choice of either in-line editorial markings
                    or information being placed in the apparatus, the option can be chosen which is
                    least obtrusive to reading the text (legibility), yet without compromising the
                    information itself (fidelity). This is however my own inference. For more
                    information about this method and result, one is referred in a footnote in the
                    guide to <emph>Mark Twain’s Notebooks and Journals</emph>. This edition,
                    however, is not available on the website, and exists only in printed form. To
                    this end, a few more salient lines in the online guideline about the theory of
                    ‘plain text’ and how it is created would have been appreciated.</p>
            <p xml:id="p21">As it is impossible to transcribe everything from the original
                    handwriting, a key part of the editor’s job is to decide what <emph>not</emph>

                            writer intended it to bear meaning […]</quote>

            <p xml:id="p22">Thus it has been decided that most line breaks, minimal differences
                    in indentations, etc., should not be depicted in the transcription. This is
                    reasonable and to be expected of a critical edition and is an important
                    qualification of the earlier quote, which stated that <emph>almost</emph> any
                    aspect of the original letter might be significant. The ‘almost’ here is
                    expounded upon - there are aspects of the text that the editors deem
                        <emph>not</emph> to be significant, such as line breaks that occur due to
                    the size of the paper. </p>
            <p xml:id="p23">The section of the guide headed <emph>Emendation of the
                        Copy-Text</emph> includes further insights into the editorial philosophy, as
                    well as itself being an exemplary text showcasing the laudable determination of
                    the editors to be as transparent as possible. This section goes into extensive
                    detail to describe when and for what reasons a letter might be emended by the
                    editor. For instance, when a letter is available only as a newspaper printing
                    (there is no handwritten original), errors are classified by the editors as
                    either originating with the typesetter (thus emended in the edition text) or
                    from Mark Twain himself (thus not emended). It seems as though this distinction
                    could have a large and nebulous gray area that is not mentioned in the guide.
                    Despite this qualm, however, it is certainly true that some errors are without
                    question typographical errors, such as transpostion or incorrect font, of which
                    they give examples. Emendation decisions can often be argued with, but of real
                    importance is whether or not the principles behind the decisions are clearly
                    stated for the reader to understand, and this guide makes every effort to do so. </p>
            <p xml:id="p24">The editors explain that, although they in principle do not correct
                    or change Twain’s original text, exceptions are made. Essentially, to be avoided
                    is anything deemed liable to cause further confustion in its transciption. They
                    cite the example of Twain’s unique usage of a dash to justify a line, which we
                    will see below when examining an actual letter. Transcribing this dash does not
                    add any meaning to the transcription but instead would add confusion, especially
                    since the original lineation is not usually reflected in the edited text. It is
                    important to note that such alterations from the editor are not silent
                    emendations, but recorded in the apparatus. Similarly, ambiguities such as
                    hyphenated compound words which are split due to a line break are necessarily
                    emended. The exact line breaks are usually not recreated in the edition text and
                    it is impossible to know if for instance (using the example from the guide) Mark
                    Twain meant waterwheel or water-wheel in such a case as when the word is split
                    due to a line break. The editors summarize this nicely in the following quote,
                    which also nicely represents, in my opinion, their general editorial philosophy: <cit>
                  <quote>The question posed by such details is not simply whether including
                            them would make the text more reliable or more complete (it would), but
                            whether they can be intelligibly and consistently included without
                            creating a series of trivial puzzles, destroying legibility, while not
                            adding significantly to information about the writer’s choice of words
                            or ability to spell. There are, in fact, a nearly infinite variety of
                            manuscript occurrences which, if transcribed, would simply present the
                            reader with a puzzle that has no existence in the original.</quote>

            <p xml:id="p25">In this quote the editors explain once again their loyalty to the
                    concept of maximum fidelity and maximum legibility, and their refusal to create
                    unnecessary puzzles. It is a philosophy that does not forget that in the end the
                    texts are intended to be read, and their job is to facilitate that act. Overall,
                    the guide does an excellent job of sharing the general principles behind the
                    creation of the edition, as well as describing in detail how the text is
                    transcribed and edited, and the reasoning behind those decisions. </p>

                    This leads to a text, also from Robert H. Hirst, which is something like an
                    introduction to scholarly editing, using practical examples from Mark Twain
                    texts. It is a fantastic resource to offer on the website. It focuses on the
                    main concepts of editing and does not shy away from addressing difficult
                    questions, such as those pertaining to the nature of a dynamic authoritative
                    text, for which Hirst uses the word ‘unstable’. This is the concept that a
                    particular critical edition is never the last word on the author’s text, but
                    part of a continuing conversation. For instance, one editor could interpret
                    something differently than another editor, or new discoveries could be made
                    which altered a text or even disproved a previous editor’s hypothesis.</p>
            <p xml:id="p27">One can also gather in this piece more about the edition’s
                    particular editorial principles. Author intention and the attempt to recreate
                    the original text are at the core of their editorial philosophy. This becomes
                    more relevant for editions of Twain’s published works rather than his letters,
                    but is interesting nonetheless. The slippery nature of author intention is not
                    addressed by Hirst. He does not mention that Twain's wishes regarding his
                    writing might have changed during his lifetime, perhaps even from one day to the
                    next, let alone the fact that claiming to know any form of author intention can
                    be extremely difficult and must sometimes involve speculation. This philosophy
                    is however typical for the style of editing found in the United States and
                    United Kingdom, based on editing Shakespeare’s plays, which Hirst himself
                        explains.<note xml:id="ftn18">‘As with most scholarly editions of American
                        authors, the editorial policies of the Mark Twain Project grew out of
                        editorial methods and theories developed originally for editing
                        Shakespeare's texts.’ <ref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20180109142400/http://www.marktwainproject.org/about_hirst_essay.shtml">https://web.archive.org/web/20180109142400/http://www.marktwainproject.org/about_hirst_essay.shtml</ref>.
                    </note> However and more importantly, one can safely say that the MTPO critical
                    editions hold up to the standards and principles expounded and presented in this
                    text. </p>

                    the last lines on the second page as well as the lines at the end of the letter
                    are heavily cancelled. According to the <emph>Guide to Editorial Practice</emph>
                    a cancellation should be depicted in the edition’s text with a rule (a
                    horizontal line through the words), but in both of these cases there is no
                    depiction of the crossed out words in the edition text at all. Why not? As
                    explained in the letter’s footnote, the editors think that these lines were
                    crossed out later, <emph>after</emph> the letter was received by Olivia. Their
                    reasoning for this is, among others, that the ink is of a different color and
                    density as the ink otherwise used in the leter. The editors explain that the
                    manner of the strike seems to be in Twain’s looping style, implying that he
                    probably crossed the words out himself at a later time, after Olivia had already
                    received the letter. The cancellation is not depicted in the edition because
                    according to the editorial practice (as mentioned above) the letters are always
                    transcribed to reflect their state when they were <emph>sent</emph>. In this
                    case the letter was likely sent without these words crossed out.</p>
            <p xml:id="p30">And yet why would Twain cross these words out later (if that is what
                    happened)? The first, not crossed out sentence reads: ‘<emph>If I’m not homesick
                        to see you, no other lover ever was homesick to see his
                        sweetheart.’</emph>
               <note xml:id="ftn21">ibid.</note> Followed by the crossed
                    out text: ‘<emph>And when I get there, remember, ‘Expedition’s the
                        word![‘]’</emph>
               <note xml:id="ftn22">ibid.</note> At the end of the letter
                    again crossed out is ‘<emph>(when I come) Expedition’s the word</emph>’<note xml:id="ftn23">ibid.</note>. The editors suggest in the footnote that these
                    words had a special meaning for Mark Twain and Olivia and that they did not want
                    anyone, even in the future, guessing at it. </p>
            <p xml:id="p31">The decision to not depict the strike in the edition text remains
                    consistent with the editors' principles. Whether or not the text was crossed out
                    before or after it was sent is however nearly impossible to establish. The
                    editors base their decision on the change of ink and pen, as well as on the
                    content of the lines. As the editors suggest, the words read as though they may
                    have had an intimate meaning for Mark Twain and Olivia. One can understand that
                    the couple might have wanted to eliminate those lines before filing the letter
                    away in storage, in order to keep it private. This is however obviously a bit of
                    a supposition on the editor’s part, but in the end the editors have to decide
                    one way or another, either for depicting the cancellation or not doing so. The
                    reader may disagree with the conclusions drawn, but such is the process. It is
                    crucial that the reader be able to see that which was omitted in the
                    transcription, as well as the editors' reasoning behind that decision. </p>
            <p xml:id="p32">There are two more small examples of the editorial principles in
                    practice which one can observe here. Firstly, in the original, the word ‘was’ is
                    underlined, and in the edited text ‘was’ is in italics. This is in keeping with
                    their guidelines for depicting emphasis, for which they even have a convenient
                        chart.<note xml:id="ftn24">See ‘Emphasis Equivalents’ in ‘Guide to Editorial
                        Practice, (MTDP 00005).’ In Mark Twain Project Online. Berkeley, Los
                        Angeles, London: University of California Press. 2007. </note> Secondly,
                    Twain’s dash after 'sweetheart' is omitted in the transcription (the emendation
                    of which is of course noted in the apparatus). As explained in the <emph>Guide
                        to Editorial Practice</emph> and mentioned above, this dash falls under the
                    category of his usage of a dash to justify the line, and thus is not transcribed
                    in order to avoid unnecessary confusion.<note xml:id="ftn25">‘On the other hand,
                        Clemens often did use the period and dash combined when the sentence period
                        fell at the end of a slightly short line in his manuscript (‘period.— | New
                        line’), a practice copied from the typographical practice of justifying
                        short lines with an em dash. These dashes likewise do not indicate a pause
                        and, because their function at line ends cannot be reproduced in a
                        transcription that does not reproduce original lineation, are always
                        emended, never transcribed.’ from ‘Guide to Editorial Practice, (MTDP
                        00005).’ In Mark Twain Project Online. Berkeley, Los Angeles, London:

            </p>
            <p xml:id="p33">The editorial commentary of this letter (called 'explanatory notes'
                    in the edition) is spectacular, and generally when one reads through the
                    letters, one sees that the commentary is one of the aspects which contribute to
                    elevate this edition. The commentary is thorough, helpful, interesting,
                    well-written and could make a fascinating volume in its own right. It is an
                    unfortunate tendency for many digital editions of letters to provide little
                    commentary, or even to include none at all. This is most often due to lack of
                    funding and time; while students or junior editors can transcribe and edit,
                    commentary is often the task of a senior editor and can be an enormous and
                    intimidating job. The amount of research, and the facts thusly uncovered are
                    always many times more than those which actually end up in the edition, and so
                    oftentimes hours - or even days - of work could be invested in the footnote of a
                    single sentence. </p>
            <p xml:id="p34">The letters written between 1877 and 1880 (about 600 letters in all)
                    are unfortunately without commentary. It is a small amount compared to the over
                    2,600 total letters which do include commentary, but they also comprise those
                    most recently published. Hopefully MTPO will continue to prioritize editorial
                    commentary, and it will be added for these letters at a later date.</p>

            <p xml:id="p36">One can enjoyably browse through the letters as though in a book,
                    but a scholar looking to do research will make use of additional tools on the
                    website, especially the search function. As an example research quest, I will do
                    a little investigating within the letters using the search functions, to see how
                    successfully I can find what I’m looking for. I am interested in learning more
                    about Twain’s stance on women’s suffrage, an important issue during his
                    lifetime, so that's where I'll begin my search.</p>
            <p xml:id="p37">

               </figure> Simply searching for ‘suffrage’ in the letters yields 18 results, with
                    a nice overview of the individual letters on the results page. On the left side
                    of the page one can filter the search results (by incoming or outgoing epistles,
                    name, etc.). Through the ‘keyword in context option’ one can, without opening
                    the letter, see the context of the keyword. This is important in my example
                    case, because Twain sometimes wrote of suffrage more generally and not just as
                    it pertained to women.<note xml:id="ftn26">Universal suffrage, for instance, was
                        also a debated issue of the time.</note> Some quite intriguing-looking
                    letters between Twain and diverse suffrage organizations are not yet edited and
                    available, but one can see their metadata. Of the 18 letters, ten were both
                    relevant to my inquiry and had been edited and published, and thus available to
                    read online.</p>
            <p xml:id="p38">When looking at the ten letters the commentary is, unsurprisingly,
                    incredibly helpful and offers a much-appreciated springboard for more detailed
                    research. The commentary refers to other letters that are relevant to women’s
                    suffrage, to lectures from Twain, etc., and references to other letters are
                    linked directly so one can easily click on and peruse them. This letter from

                    </note> is just one example of such excellent commentary. There was however a
                    small oversight at the end of one comment of this letter. The comment refers to
                    specific pages in volumes four and five of the letters. There is no way to
                    locate such particular pages (most likely additional commentary) on the website.
                    One would have to actually procure the printed letter volumes to find the exact
                    pages, which is neither a practical nor always a feasible option. In a digital
                    edition it would be more appropriate to reference for exmaple a link rather than
                    specific page numbers.</p>

            <p xml:id="p40">From this simple search and short perusal of the relevant letters I
                    was surprised to learn that at least for some time Mark Twain was not an avid
                    supporter of women’s right to vote. Twain is known today as having been a
                    progressive with regards to many topics, including women’s rights. The wikipedia
                        page<note xml:id="ftn28">
                  <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain</ref>. </note> for Twain has
                    just two sentences on the topic which state, ‘<emph>Twain was also a staunch
                        supporter of women's rights and an active campaigner for women's suffrage.
                        His ‘Votes for Women’ speech, in which he pressed for the granting of voting
                        rights to women, is considered one of the most famous in history</emph>’.
                    One sees however from our search in the MTPO letter edition and through the
                    editor’s comments that there was personal evolution over the course of Twain’s
                    lifetime, such that he ultimately became a ‘staunch supporter’ for women’s
                    rights and made such an historic speech. Only in a letter from 1874, written
                    when he was 39 years old, could I find a really positive outlook from Twain on
                    the issue: <emph>‘Both the great parties have failed. I wish we might have a
                        woman’s party now, &amp; see how that would work. I feel persuaded that in
                        extending the suffrage to women this country could lose absolutely nothing
                        &amp; might gain a great deal.</emph>’<note xml:id="ftn29">‘SLC to Ed.,

                    </note> The letters from later in his life are not available in the current
                    edition, but those letters must show the full development of his viewpoint, and
                    the viewpoint that he is better known for (he was 72 years old when he made his
                    famous ‘Votes for Women’ speech). Looking at the letters one can better
                    appreciate the complexities of Twain as a person and gain a glimpse at the man
                    behind the mythical character he has since become in the eyes of history. It is
                    refreshing to learn that someone famous for their progressive mindset had to
                    grow into some of those views, and was not a static intellectual figure, but
                    rather an organic and evolving one. Altogether this small test search in the
                    letters proved fruitful and showed that the edition is ideal for this kind of
                    research into Mark Twain’s life. The only shame is that more letters are not yet
                    edited, preventing us from gaining a truly full picture of the man and his
                    opinions.</p>

                    database, where 250 images are available from the Mark Twain Papers archive, and
                    550 catalog records of images from other sources. Additionally there is a lot of
                    project information to be found under the navigational heading <emph>About
                        MTPO</emph>, for example the extensive and helpful <emph>User Guide</emph>
                    or information about copyright and permissions.</p>
            <p xml:id="p44">To summarize, the MTPO offers a substantial amount of supplementary
                    material, mostly in the form of explanatory texts and additional documents. With
                    the exception of the databases and the simile exhibit, the academic resources
                    are presented in a static, immovable manner. They are not searchable or linked.
                    They appear as if they were pulled from printed editions, which is often
                    essentially what they are. Such an approach emphasizes the likeness to the form
                    of a traditional book. The amount and quality of the information, however, is
                    excellent.</p>

            <head>Technical Foundation and Design</head>
            <p xml:id="p45">The website was launched in 2007 and due to that fact the design is
                    understandably outdated. Although this is occasionally distracting, it does not
                    hinder either the reading of the letters or the use of the edition for research.
                    There are also some nice touches, for example the clever, witty quotes from
                    Twain which are peppered throughout the website,<note xml:id="ftn31">At the top
                        of the page titled Peer Review<ref target="http://www.marktwainproject.org/about_peerreview.shtml">http://www.marktwainproject.org/about_peerreview.shtml</ref> there is a
                        quote from Twain: ‘One mustn't criticise other people on grounds where he
                        can't stand perpendicular himself.’ (From A Connecticut Yankee in King
                        Arthur's Court, Chapter XXVI).</note> and the two letters with facsimiles
                    displayed on both the home and main pages of the website. The design of the
                    edited text itself and the editorial commentary is appealing and easy to read.
                    The structure and organization of the website could use improvement, but this is
                    most likely the result of an older navigational style. There are some links that
                    do not work and unfortunately the citations tool sometimes generates error
                    messages, among other small technical flaws, so some technological upkeep seems
                    warranted. In conclusion, the display of the edition is not at the same
                    outstanding level as the scholarly work of the edition’s content and ideally the
                    whole website would be revamped. That said, the website is more than adequate
                    for the usage of the edition.</p>
            <p xml:id="p46">It looks as though MTPO has four main databases: one for XML files
                    and images found in the printed editions, one for images of facsimiles amd
                    photographs from their archive, one for metadata, and one for long term
                    preservation. They use the open-source software eXtensible Text Framework (XTF)
                    for the display of the edition and for the search functions. XTF was created by
                    the California Digital Library and is a well established platform used by
                    numerous projects. Generally the MTPO has implemented highly standardized
                    technologies wherever possible, which has served the over ten-year old project
                    well. It is unclear exactly which kind of databases they use and if any data
                    migration was necessary over the years, but considering how much development
                    there has been in the last ten years for digital editions, the MTPO seems quite
                    up to date regarding their backend processes. They also have a system of
                    long-term preservation in place through the California Digital Library’s

            <p xml:id="p47">The technical information for this review could be gathered from the
                    project’s very extensive <emph>Technical Summary</emph>
               <note xml:id="ftn33">
                  <ref target="http://www.marktwainproject.org/about_technicalsummary.shtml">http://www.marktwainproject.org/about_technicalsummary.shtml</ref>.
                    </note>, found under <emph>About MTPO</emph>. The summary offers a great deal of
                    transparency for the backend technologies. Especially impressive are the details
                    about how TEI P4 is extended for their particular schema as well as how they
                    have solved the problem of authorial symbols that encompass multiple lines of
                    texts (like large brackets), which they call graphic groups. As someone who has
                    had to deal with precisely this problem before, such information is of great
                    interest. My only criticism here is that the quality of writing is not at the
                    same level as the other editorial texts on the website. However, the technical
                    summary is well-organized and includes helpful graphics and examples. To be even
                    more transparent the project should offer the XML files for the editions as well
                    as the schema. It is regrettable that these files are not available.<note xml:id="ftn34">I did stumble upon this xml file from the Autobiography. It
                        is however buried in the Recent Changes list and in no way displayed to be
                        actually found if desired. <ref target="http://www.marktwainproject.org/sample_MTDP10363.xml">http://www.marktwainproject.org/sample_MTDP10363.xml</ref>. </note>
                    MTPO also has an active Twitter account where they publish relevant news
                    articles about Mark Twain and the project, and ancillary of updates. It is a
                    great way to maintain relevance and visibility with users of the edition and
                    other involved parties.</p>

            <head>Conclusion</head>
            <p xml:id="p48">The digital edition of <emph>Mark Twain’s Letters 1853-1880</emph>
                    of the Mark Twain Project Online accomplishes its aims well and is undeniably an
                    essential edition for Mark Twain researchers, as well as an important source for
                    historians. The level of scholarly work, the thorough commentary, and the
                    admirable transparency make this an exemplary critical edition. The
                    supplementary material found on the website, such as the extra resources and
                    texts about the project, are well written with great attention to detail, and
                    allows for various levels of knowledge. This makes the edition highly-accessible
                    to all varieties of reader, even while being optimized for academic research. </p>
            <p xml:id="p49">While the content of the letter edition and supplementary texts on
                    the website are of the highest quality, the ‘digital’ part of the digital
                    edition appears somewhat lacking. It would be ideal if the website were
                    re-organized and re-designed and if a more dynamic concept were used for the
                    digital edition and supplementary texts. To conclude, it would be thrilling if
                    the thoroughness, modernity and meticulousness found in the text were also found
                    in the technical execution of the edition. It is a momentous project with many
                    writings and letters of Mark Twain still to be published, and it will be
                    interesting to see how it develops in the coming years.</p>
