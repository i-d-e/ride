            <p>This review concerns a collection of French dramatic texts called <emph>Théâtre
                  classique</emph>, edited by Paul Fièvre since 2007 and available at <ref target="http://www.theatre-classique.fr">http://www.theatre-classique.fr</ref>.
               Over the years, the collection has grown continually and currently provides access to
               1,080 French plays, the large majority of which have been written or published
               between 1630 and 1800. In addition to the plays’ full-text in several file formats,
               the site provides contextual information on the plays and their authors as well as a
               number of statistical and analytical perspectives on the textual data. Clearly, the
               site would benefit from a stronger focus on current standard data formats and from
               increased transparency regarding editorial principles. It is debatable whether it is
               a strength or a weakness for a digital resource to interweave data, analysis and
               contextualization as closely as <emph>Théâtre Classique</emph> does. However, given
               the focus, size and quality of the text collection as well as the additional
               functionality provided by the site, it is clear that there is no comparable or
               directly competing resource available today for French drama. In fact, <emph>Théâtre
                  classique</emph> has without a doubt been an essential enabling force for recent,
               quantitative approaches to French drama.</p>

            <p xml:id="p1">This review concerns a collection of French dramatic texts called
                  <emph>Théâtre classique</emph>, edited by Paul Fièvre since 2007 and available at
                  <ref target="http://www.theatre-classique.fr">http://www.theatre-classique.fr</ref>. Over the years, the collection has grown
               continually and currently provides access to 1,080 French plays, the large majority
               of which have been written or published between 1630 and 1800. In addition to the
               plays’ full-text in several file formats, the site provides contextual information as
               well as a number of statistical and analytical perspectives on the textual data.</p>
            <p xml:id="p2">The contents of the collection as well as the website itself are
               continually updated so it is important to note that this review applies to the
               resource as it was available in December 2017.<note xml:id="ftn1">There is a
                  dedicated page documenting the additions the collection has received over the
                  years, both in terms of content and functionality: see <ref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20180104164719/http://www.theatre-classique.fr/pages/nouveautes.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20180104164719/http://www.theatre-classique.fr/pages/nouveautes.html</ref>.</note>

         <div xml:id="div2">
            <head>Aims and content</head>
            <p xml:id="p3">The start page of the <emph>Théâtre classique</emph> site clearly states
               the contents of the text collection, namely 1,080 French plays as well as around 100
               theoretical texts on the dramatic genre. The start page also briefly explains which
               functionality the site provides. First and foremost, the full texts themselves can be
               consulted and downloaded in several formats (HTML, plain text and PDF, but not
               XML-TEI). Moreover, the site provides additional perspectives on the text collection,
               notably via a number of statistics (word frequencies by dramatic character, lists of
               rhyming words by play, word searches across plays, play’s locations, etc.) as well as
               background information (such as biographical information on the authors represented
               and a bibliography).</p>
            <p xml:id="p4">The site does not state any specific aims it pursues, from which this
               reviewer concludes that it has a primarily documentary and enabling aspiration,
               rather than pursuing any specific research- or teaching-oriented objectives. The
               nature of the texts being made available clearly places this text collection in the
               disciplinary context of Literary Studies, more precisely of the study of French
               Classical and Enlightenment drama.</p>
            <p xml:id="p5">The site provides file formats primarily intended for reading of
               individual plays (HTML and PDF) as well as a very simple plain text format (TXT with
               very basic document-level metadata), but no version of the plays that would provide
               rich document-level metadata and detailed structural or other markup. It is true that
               the site does provide a number of functionalities that enable quantitative,
               statistical perspectives on the text collection. However, the site does not
               facilitate the bulk download of the materials it presents.</p>
            <p xml:id="p6">The collection is focused on a single but broadly defined genre of
               literary texts, namely dramatic texts in verse and prose, on a large but relatively
               clearly defined period, namely 1630-1800, and on one language, namely French. There
               are some exceptions to this focus, however: First, around a dozen texts have been
               written or published before 1630. Second, there are 106 plays that have been written
               or published after 1800; they are, however, spread out between 1800 and 1930 in a way
               that, with the exception of the 1880s, only a small number of plays are present for
               each decade. In addition, there are 23 plays by Ancient Greek authors such as
               Sophocles, Euripides or Seneca, published in their nineteenth-century French
               translations. Despite these exceptions, 939 (or 87 %) out of the 1,080 total plays
               have been written or published between 1630 and 1800.</p>

            <head>Methods</head>
            <div xml:id="div3.1">
               <head>Design, selection and composition</head>
               <p xml:id="p7">There is no information on the rationale according to which the texts
                  contained in the <emph>Theâtre classique</emph> collection have been selected,
                  other than the fact that French plays published or written between 1630 and 1800
                  are the primary focus of the collection. One does notice that most highly
                  canonized authors are represented with their entire (or virtually entire) dramatic
                  oeuvre on <emph>Théâtre classique</emph>: this is true, for example, for Pierre
                  Corneille, Thomas Corneille, Jean Racine, Molière, Marivaux or Voltaire. Beyond
                  the highly canonized authors, many second- and third-tier authors are also
                  represented, although it is more difficult in these cases to assess the level of
                  completeness of their works. Inevitably, many authors and individual plays are
                  also missing.</p>
               <p xml:id="p8">Estimating the level of completeness of a collection of literary texts
                  relative to the complete relevant production of texts is notoriously hard. The
                     <emph>Théâtre classique</emph> site provides some relevant numbers: for
                  example, the editor has compiled a list of known plays for the period 1589 to 1720
                  which currently runs to 1,919 plays. And they link to the César database, which
                  contains references for virtually all known French plays (of any length and
                  description) for the period 1600-1800 and which lists 18,830 titles.<note xml:id="ftn2">See: <ref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716205828/http://cesar.org.uk/cesar2/">https://web.archive.org/web/20170716205828/http://cesar.org.uk/cesar2/</ref>.</note>
                  With around 945 plays for the period 1600-1800, <emph>Théatre classique</emph>
                  therefore contains about 5% of the entire production of dramatic works, although
                  this proportion is probably much higher for the full-length plays (say, the
                  five-act tragedies and comedies) in the collection. Whatever this proportion may
                  be, there is no discernible attempt on the part of the editors to create a
                  balanced or representative text collection.</p>
               <p xml:id="p9">Beyond the sheer number of individual texts, the size of the
                  collection can be assessed in more fine-grained ways. There is a table called
                  “Statistique générale” which contains information about the number of acts,
                  scenes, dramatic characters, speech acts, lines of verse, sentences in prose,
                  words and characters for each of the 1,080 plays. According to this table, the
                  text collection currently contains 3,218 acts, 24,154 scenes, 10,837 dramatic
                  characters, 342,939 speech acts, 847,006 verses, 284,098 sentences in prose,
                  10,135,868 word tokens and 53,727,172 characters.<note xml:id="ftn3">The table
                     actually specifies a number of 107,454,344 characters, which appears to be
                     exactly twice the correct number, when summing the relevant column in the
                     per-play table also provided. Such a high number would indicate an average word
                     length of more than 10 characters, which is not realistic.</note> As for the
                  composition of the collection, besides the main text collection of 1,080 plays,
                  the site also presents around 100 theoretical, critical or polemical texts
                  relevant to French theater of the Classical Age and the Enlightenment period. The
                  main internal divisions of the collection of plays regards the categories of
                  author, year of publication and (relatively fine-grained) dramatic subgenre.</p>
               <p xml:id="p10">The <emph>Théâtre classique</emph> site is almost silent on the exact
                  institutional and organizational conditions under which the text collection has
                  been and continues to be produced. A brief “Introduction” states that the idea for
                  the site dates back to the early 1990s and specifies that plays already available
                  in digital form by Molière, Corneille and Racine formed the initial core of the
                  collection, first published in 2007. Finally, the “Introduction” vaguely mentions
                  a privileged relation to the “Centre d’étude de la langue et des littératures
                  françaises” (CELLF) at the University Paris-IV Sorbonne, while the front page
                  mentions several relevant projects to which <emph>Théâtre classique</emph> is
                  related. Finally, it appears that most transcriptions rely on digital facsimiles
                  available from the Bibliothèque nationale de France’s “Gallica” digital library.
                  However, whether Paul Fièvre transcribed and encoded all the (currently 1080)
                  texts or collaborated with others in this task, is not clearly documented.<note xml:id="ftn4">“Des bonnes volontés ont offert des textes” is all we learn about
                     this in the “Introduction”, although when browsing the collection, sometimes
                     external editors are mentioned, as in the case of Scudéry’s <emph>Le vassal
                        généreux</emph>, for which the title page states: “Texte établi par Sophie
                     Maillard (Mémoire de maîtrise sous la direction de M. Georges Forestier U.F.R
                     de Littérature française et comparée, 1997)”. For a number of texts, Ernest
                     Fièvre is named as the editor even when Paul Fièvre appears as the
                     publisher.</note> It is safe to assume, however, that the large majority of
                  texts have not been freely available in digital, full-text form before
                     <emph>Théâtre classique</emph> published them.</p>
               <p xml:id="p11">The relatively large number of texts, the generic and temporal scope
                  of the collection and the additional functionality of the site make <emph>Théâtre
                     classique</emph> a “corpus of primary sources” in terms of the typology
                  suggested by Henny-Krahmer and Neuber 2017 in their Editorial on “Reviewing
                  Digital Text Collections”. Indeed, the scope of <emph>Théâtre classique</emph> is
                  defined in terms of time period, genre and language, but is open with respect to
                  authors and their level of canonization or recognition. It is unclear whether any
                  formal quality assurance of the transcriptions, annotations and metadata has been
                  or is being performed. This reviewer, when using the texts, has noticed that the
                  quality of the transcriptions is generally quite high, although it is certainly
                  not flawless and, more importantly, somewhat uneven across the collection.<note xml:id="ftn5">This reviewer has sent lists of transcription, encoding, metadata
                     and linking errors to the editor in the past; most of them have been corrected
                     in the meantime, several are still there even years later. Inspecting the
                     XML-TEI files shows that they are not always valid against the standard TEI P4
                     schema. The absence of a public version of the reference files and of any
                     structured way of submitting and resolving this type of errors is primarily to
                     blame for this state of affairs.</note> Despite this fact, the quality of the
                  texts is certainly sufficient for most if not all reading purposes as well as for
                  most if not all purposes of quantitative analysis. As far as the level of care
                  that went into establishing the texts and, just as importantly, the level of
                  transparency to the users of the process of establishing the texts is concerned
                  (more on this below), this is certainly no scholarly text edition, but could
                  rather be described as a text collection for scholarly use.</p>

            <div xml:id="div3.2">
               <head>Data Modelling</head>
               <p xml:id="p12">This aspect of the <emph>Théâtre classique</emph> collection is
                  particularly tricky to assess, as most of the data modeling is actually happening
                  behind the scenes, in the XML-TEI files not officially available to the users.</p>
               <p xml:id="p13">If one does look at these XML-TEI files, it becomes clear that the
                  texts have been encoded with two primary concerns, both of which are essential for
                  scholars in literary studies: The first concern is to encode the structure of the
                  plays with the level of detail we have come to be accustomed to for plays encoded
                  in TEI, i.e. with cast lists, acts and verses, speeches and speakers all neatly
                  marked-up, including identifiers for speakers as well as paragraphs and sentences
                  or verses. Considerable care has also gone into marking up things like verses
                  split into several lines. The second concern is to provide very detailed metadata
                  about the texts, not just on the level of authors and plays (where time and place
                  of birth and death for each author in the teiHeader are encoded, for example, or
                  the primary domain of thematic inspiration for each play is documented), but also
                  on the level of the dramatis personae, who are characterized (in many though
                  certainly not all cases) with respect to their gender, age, social status and
                  romantic involvement.</p>
               <p xml:id="p14">Based on these two types of information, structural annotations and
                  metadata, most of the statistical analyses provided by the <emph>Théâtre
                     classique</emph> site are generated (more on those below) and many kinds of
                  computational analyses, particularly literary network analyses, are facilitated.
                  Unfortunately, only very little of this information is made directly visible to
                  the users in the HTML, PDF and TXT files. The TXT files include some basic
                  metadata, as they have a brief Dublin Core metadata section prepended to them, but
                  very little explicit structural annotation. The HTML files also have this Dublin
                  Core metadata and, in addition, provide some of the structural annotation, albeit
                  simplified and packaged somewhat inelegantly in table and paragraph elements
                  enhanced with various class attributes. A far cry from the beautiful readability
                  and explicitness of the underlying XML-TEI encoding!</p>
               <p xml:id="p15">Another important aspect of the transcription and encoding is that
                  there is tacit spelling normalisation and/or modernisation applied in the
                  transcriptions, not just in the HTML, TXT and PDF reading versions, but also in
                  the XML-TEI source files. It is tacit both in the sense that neither the teiHeader
                  nor the <emph>Théâtre classique</emph> website explains the details of this
                  practice or even mentions it at all, and in the sense of being implicitly
                  practiced in the XML-TEI source files, without marking locations of normalisation
                  / modernisation or documenting both the original reading and the normalised /
                  modernised reading. Again, while this is hard to achieve elegantly in HTML, of
                  course XML-TEI has all the affordances to make this easily possible. However, if
                  made transparent, it would be a legitimate choice to proceed to such a
                  normalisation. It is true that this has several benefits, especially when one
                  targets literary scholars interested in semantic, structural or stylistic aspects
                  of the texts or when the primary aim is to provide convenient reading texts.
                  However, one is sure to disappoint historical linguists interested in variation
                  and diachronic development of spelling conventions as well as scholarly editors
                  interested in a maximally trustworthy rendering of a specific document.<note xml:id="ftn6">Note that there is no word-level linguistic annotation (with
                     lemmata and part-of-speech annotation, for example), as practiced by the Early
                     Print or the Folger Shakespeare projects. This is another aspect showing that
                     the users Paul Fièvre has in mind are literary scholars rather than linguists,
                     although the former also benefit from linguistic annotations.</note>

               they have been proposed in in 2002 (P4). It is one of the most unfortunate decisions
               of the editor not to make these XML-TEI versions officially available to the
                  users.<note xml:id="ftn7">Particularly motivated users will find ways of

               information on this aspect on the <emph>Théâtre classique</emph> site, there does not
               appear to be any technical interface, such as an API or an OAI-PMH interface, for the

               </figure> The main types of information of the site can be divided into three groups:
               The first and arguably the most important of them contains the page giving access to
               the text files. It can be reached through the main navigation entry “Lire” and simply
               provides a complete list of all 1,080 plays. Using this interactive list (built using
               the HTML Table Filter Generator),<note xml:id="ftn8">See <ref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20180104190210/http://tablefilter.free.fr/">https://web.archive.org/web/20180104190210/http://tablefilter.free.fr/</ref>
                  for details.</note> the collection of plays can be filtered according to several
               criteria (see <ref type="crossref" target="#img1">Fig. 1</ref>). Notably,
               subcollections can be viewed based on author, year of publication and dramatic
               subgenre. This is also possible in combination (for example, revealing all comedies
               published in the 1670s), although there is no “advanced search” option which would
               conveniently allow to combine several criteria into a complex search query (such as
               “all comédies and tragedies published between 1680 and 1710”).</p>

                     information is provided when scrolling down in the live view.</head>
               </figure> The second type of information of the site is represented by materials
               contextualizing the plays. Relevant information is scattered across different pages.
               Under the main menu item “Rechercher”, for example, users find a “Petit lexique du
               théâtre classique” containing explanations of terms, such as place or person names
               (see <ref type="crossref" target="#img2">Fig. 2</ref>). Interestingly, this table is
               automatically generated from the notes contained in the plays.<note xml:id="ftn9">On
                  the same page, users are also promised a “Lexique des archaismes”, but the
                  corresponding link produces a “404 page not found” error. It appears that this
                  dictionary of archaisms has been incorporated into the more general “lexique”,
                  where archaisms also appear.</note> Under the main menu item “Liste et corpus”,
               two lists of plays are provided which represent not just the plays present in the
                  <emph>Théâtre classique</emph> collection, but are attempts to document the
               complete dramatic production of certain time periods as a reference. (For both of
               these lists, there is a brief note indicating their preliminary character.) The main
               menu entry “Auteurs” leads the users to a long page with biographical notes extracted
               from a reference work published in 1763 and called <emph>Dictionnaire portatif
                  historique et littéraire des théâtres, concernant l'origine des différents théâtre
                  de Paris</emph>. The main entry item “Critique/Antique” contains, among other
               things, a link to a bibliography of critical, theoretical and historical works on the
               drama of the Classical Age and the Enlightenment.</p>
            <p xml:id="p21">The third type of information provided are statistical or quantitative
               analyses and data derived from the texts themselves.<note xml:id="ftn10">In addition
                  to these types of information, there is also a page with the “Nouveautés” (linked
                  to only from the start page) that lists all the additions to the site, whether in
                  content or in functionality, in an inverted chronological order. This actually
                  provides a fascinating insight into the growth and development of <emph>Théâtre
                     classique</emph>. (In comparison, the more loosely structured “blog” page seems
                  less useful to this reviewer).</note> This type of information can be accessed in
               several places. The main menu entry “Compter” leads to a page with basic numerical
               information about each play (year of publication, number of acts and scenes, number
               of dramatic characters and speech acts, number of verses, words and characters as
               well as some ratios, such as mean number of verses per speech act). Some of these and
               additional data is also available from each play’s HTML view, for example a view of
               the number of speech acts by act/scene and by dramatic character. The main menu item
               “Comparer” gives access to a page where users can select two texts from drop-down
               menus to obtain the same basic statistics for both texts side-by-side (see <ref type="crossref" target="#img3">Fig. 3</ref>). The selection of these statistical
               indicators appears weakly motivated. Some of them are unsurprising, like the number
               of words or speech acts. Others are more unusual, like the “indice de fractionnement”
               which basically gives a quantitative indicator of how many verses are split into more
               than one line. Also, the main menu item “Statistique” provides access to several
               analytic views. For example, the “tableaux croisées” lets the users define two
               criteria, for example “genre” and “vers/prose”, and obtain a table of the number of
               plays belonging to any of the joint categories, such as prose comedies or verse
                  tragedies.<note xml:id="ftn11">Again, the data for these tables appears to be
                  generated automatically from the textual data. This is an elegant solution and
                  helps keep the statistical data up-to-date. However, it also lets encoding errors
                  creep in, for example when there are apparently two comedies classified as being
                  in “Prose” (with a capital “p”) while other plays are either “prose”, “verse” or
                  “mixte”.</note> One of the most interesting functions is the one providing a
               “tableau lexical” for each text, broken down by act or dramatic character. At the
               time of writing, unfortunately, this view only produces a list of errors instead of
               showing the data. It is also possible to search for a term in any one play (this
               search also lets the users define additional constraints, like the initial or final
               position in a verse) or in all the plays by any one author, or across all plays.
               Furthermore, there are similar views on the places of the dramatic action, the
               locations where plays were represented, the plays corresponding to certain thematic
               inspirations (like “histoire de France” or “mythe romain”). In many cases, these
               views also provide further views like all the dramatic characters appearing in plays
               belonging to the “mythe romain” inspiration.</p>
            <p xml:id="p22">It should be underlined that these statistical or analytical views are
               unusually rich, albeit somewhat under-documented. There is in fact an abundance of
               such views, with the interactive tables sometimes augmented with various visual
               renderings of quantitative information (line charts, bar charts, visual tables,
               concept trees). It is true that they all reveal some potentially interesting or
               relevant aspect of the plays. However, their purpose or usefulness does not always
               become clear and the underlying data cannot usually be downloaded for follow-up
                  analyses.<note xml:id="ftn12">To give just one example, it is possible to display,
                  for each play one is consulting, the list of the dramatic character speaking first
                  in each of the play’s scenes, a display that even includes a visualisation of this
                  data. While no doubt of interest to some, this information is only a small
                  snapshot of possibly relevant data concerning the position, sequence and rhythm of
                  speech acts and the hierarchies or relationships between interlocutors. Many more
                  would need to be taken into account for any serious engagement with such
                  issues.</note> This sense of limited usefulness is not helped by inconsistent
               navigation structures and by several pages with system errors.</p>
            <p xml:id="p23">The “Introduction” mentioned above also very briefly states some of the
               technical implementation details, such as the fact that the website has been built
               primarily using PHP or that the texts have been encoded since the beginning in TEI P4
               lite (“s’inspirer de la DTD TEI.2 allégé”, the author states; note that no DTD or
               schema is made available). When <emph>Théâtre classique</emph> went online in 2007,
               TEI P4 was the established state of the art in text encoding for the humanities,
               although TEI P5 was published that same year and most if not all TEI collections
               produced since then have been using P5. This reviewer sees two legitimate reasons for
               the continued use of TEI P4: first, Paul Fièvre is using the affordances of the TEI
               in ways that make it challenging (although by no means impossible) to transform his
               data to TEI P5 without some loss of information.<note xml:id="ftn13">Together with
                  Ulrike Henny-Krahmer, this reviewer has actually done this for a substantial
                  number of plays. The main challenge to the transformation are the rich metadata
                  annotations on the elements for authors, plays and dramatic characters, which we
                  decided to extract and document separately from the TEI files in order to obtain
                  valid TEI P5 files. See <ref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20180104190330/https://github.com/cligs/theatreclassique">https://web.archive.org/web/20180104190330/https://github.com/cligs/theatreclassique</ref>
                  for the result.</note> And second, the entire site infrastructure for generating
               the HTML, TXT and PDF versions as well as for generating the multiple analytic and
               statistical perspectives on the data no doubt rely on the exact structures present in
               the TEI P4 files. In the absence of substantive institutional and financial support,
               the time and effort for changing this system would arguably be too high.</p>

            <p xml:id="p24">There is a brief introduction to the text collection and there are brief
               explanations for each of the pages providing additional analytic functionality.
               Overall, however, the documentation of the project (regarding transcription
               guidelines, text annotation, metadata scheme, technical implementation of the site,
               selection criteria for the texts, to name just a few) is clearly insufficient for a
               project of this scope and richness of materials.</p>
            <p xml:id="p25">The <emph>Théâtre classique</emph> site also does not provide sufficient
               information on rights and licences. The “Introduction” does make the following
               statement: “Les résultats présentés sur ce site peuvent être utilisés pour
               publication scientifique et pour une utilisation pédagogique. La mention de l'URL de

               résultats est vivement recommandée.” The HTML and PDF versions of each play usually
               have the following mention: “Publié par Paul Fièvre © Théâtre classique”. Neither of
               these statements differentiate appropriately between the full-text transcriptions
               (which must most likely be considered to be in the public domain),<note xml:id="ftn14">At least, this is what a 2014 decision of the French Tribunal de
                  grande instance appears to suggest (see Legalis 2014).</note> the markup provided
               by the editor (which could have been more clearly licenced, for example using an
               appropriate Creative Commons licence), and the statistics derived from the text
               collection and presented on the site (which, as factual data, can most likely not be
               subjected to any copyright claims, although this may be different for the
               visualisations). The site does not provide a clear citation suggestion.</p>
            <p xml:id="p26">In terms of identification and citation, the text collection does
               provide unique identifiers for each text, in the form of a canonical URL included in
               the Dublin Core metadata field called “DC.identifier” provided with each plain text
               and HTML version of the plays. For Balthazar Baro’s play <emph>Célinde</emph>, for
               example, this URL takes the following form: “<ref target="http://www.theatre-classique.fr/pages/BARO_CELINDE.xml">http://www.theatre-classique.fr/pages/BARO_CELINDE.xml</ref>”. While
               “BARO_CELINDE” is indeed the basename of several files in the system, this identifier
               has several drawbacks, most notably that nothing guarantees the persistence of the
               URL. (And indeed, the above link does not lead to an XML version of the play, but to
               a “404 file not” found). Beyond the site itself, the plays are not publicly and
               officially archived anywhere and therefore, cannot be provided with formal DOIs
               (Digital Object Identifiers). Also, the <emph>Théâtre classique</emph> site does not
               provide information about its archiving strategy and does not appear to have any
               official institutional backing.</p>
            <p xml:id="p27">Based on the vague licensing terms, the absence of a publicly available
               fully-annotated version of the texts and the lack of an appropriate archiving and
               identification strategy, the long-term availability and re-usability of the text
               collection is in serious doubt. Individual initiatives that have, with consent from
               the editor of the <emph>Théâtre classique</emph> collection, created public copies of
               the text collection, both in its original TEI P4 version and in automatically derived

            <head>Conclusion</head>
            <p xml:id="p28">Given the focus, size and quality of the text collection as well as the
               additional functionality provided by the site, it is clear that there is no
               comparable or directly competing resource available today for French drama. In
               languages other than French, text collections of similar size and scope exist, for
               example the drama subcorpus in TextGrid’s “Digitale Bibliothek” (666 German-language
               plays freely available in XML-TEI) or the “Drama Site” of the Early Print initiative
               (859 English-language plays freely available in XML-TEI).<note xml:id="ftn16">See
                  TextGrid 2016 and Early Print 2018. To conveniently access the plays extracted by
                  the DLINA group, see: <ref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20180104190920/https://github.com/dlina/project/tree/master/data">https://web.archive.org/web/20180104190920/https://github.com/dlina/project/tree/master/data</ref>.
                  An infinitely less useful but still comparable resource is the <emph>Teatro
                     Español del Siglo de Oro</emph> collection of Spanish plays (848 plays, neither
                  in XML-TEI nor freely available); see TESO 2018.</note> For the study of French
               Classical and Enlightenment drama in (digital) literary studies, the <emph>Théâtre
                  classique</emph> collection has clearly been a game-changer, enabling research
               into the dramatic production of these two centuries not only at an unprecedented
               breadth, depth and scale, but also with a host of innovative methods. As such,
                  <emph>Théâtre classique</emph> texts are being used in a wide range of research
               projects in France as well as internationally, by groups like Dramacode or DLINA,
               especially by groups practicing literary network analysis.<note xml:id="ftn17">For
                  recent examples of research using <emph>Théâtre classique</emph> texts, see for
                  example <emph>Revue d'Historiographie du Théâtre</emph> 2017.</note> Similarly,
               this reviewer’s research on French drama in the areas of stylometry, topic modeling
               and more generally genre analysis would simply not have been possible without this
                  resource.<note xml:id="ftn18">Schöch 2017, for example.</note> This is all the
               more impressive as the project does not appear to have benefitted from formal
               institutional support, substantial third-party funding or a formal project team.</p>
            <p xml:id="p29">This is not to say the collection could not be improved. The major
               problematic aspect this reviewer sees in the <emph>Théâtre classique</emph>
               collection is the almost systematic way it presents textual and statistical data in
               specific ways to the users via the graphical user interface, but keeps relatively
               quiet about the underlying technical realization and, more importantly, does not make
               the underlying data easily available to the users who wish to perform analyses going
               beyond what the site has to offer. The painful lack of publicly available XML-TEI
               versions of the plays is the most important point in case, but there are many other
               examples, among them the absence of a bulk-download feature for the existing formats,
               of conveniently downloadable versions of the statistics pages or the rich
               metadata.</p>
            <p xml:id="p30">Another fundamental issue this reviewer sees in the <emph>Théâtre
                  classique</emph> site is that there is an almost programmatic, but ultimately
               detrimental lack of ‘separation of concerns’. The single most important
               accomplishment of the site is that it provides access to an unprecedented and unique
               number and variety of French plays from the Classical Age and Enlightenment. One
               secondary contribution of the site lies in providing contextual information on the
               plays, authors and period, and while this is no doubt useful, it would actually
               either warrant a dedicated site of resources aimed at researchers and students or a
               concerted effort on Wikipedia, if it is to be truly useful. The third contribution of
               the site lies in the various data-oriented views on the plays. Despite the wide
               variety of analytical perspectives offered, the fact that any user can only follow in
               the exact path defined by the editor of the site, with little room for flexibly
               adapting the queries, makes this much less useful than it may at first appear. If
                  <emph>Théâtre classique</emph> focused all their efforts on providing the texts,
               annotation and metadata in an up-to-date, standardized format (such as XML-TEI P5),
               then users could feed that data into established and powerful, generic corpus
               analysis tools such as TXM (which handles XML-TEI as well as metadata quite
               graciously) or into more specialized, research-oriented analytical pipelines such as
               those made available by the DLINA or the Dramacode groups instead of relying on the
               functionality provided by the <emph>Théâtre classique</emph> site.</p>
            <p xml:id="p31">It could be argued that one of the strengths of <emph>Théâtre
                  classique</emph> is precisely the close relation between the encoded texts and the
               various analytical views on the texts. In the opinion of this reviewer, however,
               there are fundamental advantages to untangling data and tools: it allows everyone to
               focus on what they do best, avoids duplication of effort and could be a driver for
               innovation as well as an incentive for standardization and collaboration.</p>
