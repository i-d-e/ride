            <p>Charles Darwin‚Äôs correspondences are an invaluable resource for understanding his
                    theories and works as well as English social life of the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century. About 15,000 letters are known, of which many appear for
                    the first time in this hybrid print and digital edition of the <emph>Darwin
                        Correspondence Project</emph>. It presents an authoritative edition of the
                    letters from and to Darwin that is based on up-to-date scholarly standards and
                    that is as comprehensive as possible. The completion of this project in progress
                    is scheduled for 2022. Currently, all letters until 1875 are online with full
                    transcriptions, and all remaining letters until Darwin‚Äôs death in 1882 are
                    available in their metadata and summaries. Explanatory notes and extensive
                    contextual essays provide valuable background information. The technical
                    realisation of the project via the Epsilon framework is convincing as the
                    edition is intuitively easy to use. It is, however, not possible to view the
                    TEI-encoded files of the letters or to download the transcriptions and essays.
                    With plenty of additional material, the <emph>Darwin Correspondence
                        Project</emph> exceeds the scope of an edition and presents a widely
                    interlinked online project that makes it a valuable and rich resource.</p>

            <p xml:id="p1">With the name Charles Darwin (1809‚Äì1882) most people immediately
                    associate the theory of evolution, natural selection, and the idea of the
                    survival of the fittest. Darwin is counted among ‚Äòthe most influential figures
                    in human history‚Äô,<note xml:id="ftn1">
                  <ref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20180716170917/https://www.newscientist.com/round-up/darwin-200/">https://web.archive.org/web/20180716170917/https://www.newscientist.com/round-up/darwin-200/</ref>.</note>
                    who radically changed the self-perception of mankind. However, Darwin not only
                    conducted research in the field of evolution. He also worked in the fields of
                    geology, palaeontology, zoology, and botany. During his lifetime lasting more
                    than 70 years, he was in regular contact with numerous scientists, scholars, and
                    savants, engaging in intellectual debate and discussing new ideas. Darwin was an
                    observant contemporary of the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century and an important
                    witness to the developments of his time.</p>
            <p xml:id="p2">Darwin maintained extensive correspondences with a large number of
                    people, with friends, family members, colleagues, and fellow scientists. His
                    letters‚Äîas well as the letters he received from many hundreds of
                    correspondents‚Äîprovide substantial insight into his intellectual and scientific
                    networks as well as the development of his theories. Besides discussing his
                    ideas with his peers, Darwin used letters to collect data, figures, and facts to
                    support and verify his theories.<note xml:id="ftn2">

                    He made marginal notes, colour coded subjects with pens and crossed out whole
                    paragraphs of information already included in his writings. Darwin cut out
                    pieces of information of the letters and filed them with his notes or stuck them
                    into his experiment book.<note xml:id="ftn3">

                    Many letters also contain diagrams, drawings, or specimens.<note xml:id="ftn4">

                        respectively) or the best available source against which they are checked

                        The original spelling by Darwin and his correspondence partners are

                        be reproduced. Unfortunately, more detailed information on single text
                        phenomena and their editorial handling are missing from the section
                        ‚ÄòEditorial policy and practice‚Äô. Hopefully, the editing guidelines will

               <p xml:id="p9">Darwin often marked passages and made marginal notes and

                        several (attached) pages (Burkhardt, and Smith 1985, xxix). These notes are
                        handled in two different ways. First, notes on letters he received are

                        letters appear in the print edition in the appendix and not in the
                        transcribed text. As the print edition‚Äôs chapter on editorial policy states,
                        the ‚Äòclear-text‚Äô method was followed to keep the text free of brackets
                        recording deletions, insertions, and other changes (Burkhardt, and Smith
                        1985, xxvi). At present, these changes can only be found in the print
                        edition‚Äôs appendix, and are not included in the digital edition.<note xml:id="ftn20">E.g. the print edition records six alterations by Darwin
                            in a letter to his father Robert Darwin from 23 October 1825 (Burkhardt,
                            and Smith 1985, 573), but the digital edition does not give this
                            information. <ref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20191121112126/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/DCP-LETT-16.xml">https://web.archive.org/web/20191121112126/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/DCP-LETT-16.xml</ref>.</note>

                            ‚Äònot yet available‚Äô suggests that an online presentation is intended,

                  </figure> The display of the individual letter is clearly arranged and
                        self-explanatory. The main part of the screen is occupied with the
                        transcription. Below, one can find annotations by Darwin in the letters he
                        received in the ‚ÄòCD annotations‚Äô section, and the commentary in the
                        ‚ÄòFootnotes‚Äô section. Occasionally, more detailed information on special
                        circumstances or mentioned people and works is desirable. For example, a
                        letter by Darwin to his fianc√©e Emma Wedgwood from November 1838 deals with
                        their recent engagement and future plans which is not obvious to the reader
                        at first sight.<note xml:id="ftn24">

                        </note> There is no commentary at all for this letter, and only the summary
                        in the metadata section states that this is the first letter after their
                        engagement which finally makes the context and the content of the letter
                        more comprehensible to the reader. Sometimes one wishes for more information
                        when people and their works are mentioned. Full names are given in the
                        commentary but no other information like dates of birth and death, or the

                            not deliver a result e.g. in the letter to Charles Lyell from 25 August

                            a bibliographic reference to ‚ÄòWells 1815‚Äô is given in footnote¬†4. In the

                        results for bibliographic items are just shown in a list in which the items
                        are not clickable. Therefore, the books or articles do not have individual
                        pages (yet?) where one might, for example, trace the steps to other letters
                        with other correspondents in which a respective text was also mentioned.</p>

                        into the index page as the names in the letters are encoded and therefore
                        retrievable. As it is now, the user can only generate such a list by using
                        the search box. The search results, however, only approximately comply with
                        such a list as all letters from and to the respective person and all letters

                        has not been realised, and such a tool has been long-awaited by scholars

            <p xml:id="p25">It has become clear that the <emph>Darwin Correspondence
                        Project</emph> goes beyond a ‚Äòmere edition‚Äô and in the direction of a
                    dynamic and widely interlinked web project. Next to locating and researching all
                    letters by and to Darwin to build up an inventory that is as complete as
                    possible, the publication of the letter texts and the commentary is accompanied
                    by extensive contextual essays and articles providing valuable background
                    information. The essays in the section ‚ÄòDarwin's Life in Letters‚Äô,<note xml:id="ftn59">

                    particular period, characterise key correspondence partners, and put them in
                    relation to Darwin and his biography. Bibliographic references offer an
                    extensive overview of relevant literature, and links to letters related to the
                    person or topic discussed direct the user straight to those letters.</p>

                    page is available. The user does not know about additions or features to come.
                    Editorial and technical documentation as well as Encoding Guidelines should be
                    published online now (and not only when finishing the project in 2022 if that is
                    intended) to make the edition more transparent as scholars and the public read
                    and work with the substantial amount of already edited texts and essays. One
                    wishes the greatest possible readership and reception for such a great project,
                    and awaits curiously the remaining letters and, if intended, new essays and
                    additional material with even more background information. </p>
