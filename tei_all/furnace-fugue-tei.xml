               <emph>Furnace and Fugue</emph> is a digital edition of Michael Maier’s (1568-1622)
                  <emph>opus magnum</emph>, the emblem book <emph>Atalanta fugiens</emph> (1617/18)
               in which Latin and German texts are paired with images and musical fugues in an
               enigmatic way to engage users of the book in deep meditation on alchemical subjects.
               The digital edition of the text itself, including an English translation based on a
               17th century manuscript, is accompanied by a number of scholarly essays. A main
               feature is the MEI player, which includes a piano roll visualisation that allows
               users to experience the musicological makeup of <emph>Atalanta fugiens</emph> even
               without a background in music theory. The edition is a beautifully designed “haute
               couture” edition, intended to provide an example for the future of digital scholarly
               publishing. The project has used digital editing effectively to enable the multimedia
               experience that Michael Maier had likely envisioned for <emph>Atalanta
                  fugiens.</emph> but which was previously inaccessible to most users of the
               book.</p>

                  2010</ref>, 150). Early modern emblematics tend to be meant as food for thought,
               whereby readers (or maybe rather, users) of the emblem book meditate upon the often
               obscure symbolism to get a moral message. Maier’s <emph>Atalanta fugiens</emph> is
               innovative in its adaptation of emblematics for alchemy and in its addition of a
               third layer (music) to the already multi-medial emblematics (consisting of text and
               image). Since both alchemy and emblematics on their own have a reputation of being
               somewhat hard to unriddle, the combination thereof supplies as an ideal source for a
               digital edition, offering lots of opportunities for including additional information,
               data enrichment, or other explanatory resources. More information about
                  <emph>Atalanta fugiens</emph> can be found in <emph>Furnace and Fugue</emph> as

            <head>Atalanta Fugiens, 1617/18</head>
            <p xml:id="p4">Michael Maier (1568-1622) was a German iatrochymist (‘alchemist and
               doctor’) recognized for a number of alchemical publications in the early 17th
               century. Among his works, the alchemical emblem book <emph>Atalanta fugiens</emph>
                  (<ref type="crossref" target="#maier1618a">1618a</ref>) stands out, as it is
               described as “one of the most beautiful books of alchemical literature of all time”
                  (<ref type="crossref" target="#figala_neumann1989">Figala and Neumann 1989</ref>,
               49-50). Since the seminal 1969 study by Helena M. E. De Jong, <emph>Atalanta
                  fugiens</emph> is considered the masterpiece of Maier’s oeuvre, probably because
               of its unusual multimedia combination of text, image, and music (<ref type="crossref" target="#leibenguth2002">Leibenguth 2002</ref>, 5-6).<note xml:id="ftn10">De Jong
                  provided an overview of the sources for the mottos in Maier’s emblems in <ref type="crossref" target="#jong2002">Jong 2002</ref>, 330-33.</note> </p>
            <p xml:id="p5">Despite the fact that the whole range of possible interpretations of
               Maier’s multimedia masterpiece will probably never run out,<note xml:id="ftn11">As
                  Principe argues: “Although the original sources of the imagery lie in earlier
                  texts, Maier augments them with further connections, allusions, and meanings of
                  his own. The epigrams are so intricate that it seems unlikely that any one reader
                  would ever ‘get’ all the references, allusions, connections, and puns.” In: <ref type="crossref" target="#principe2013">Principe 2013</ref>, 174.</note> there
               is consensus that Maier intended to promote alchemy in the context of courtly
               education and entertainment, for which emblems surely were an ideal medium.<note xml:id="ftn12">Figala and Neumann write: “In general, Maier pursued the aim in his
                  published books of raising and maintaining alchemy in the opinion of the educated
                  public. He strove expressly to give it the rank in the contemporary hierarchy of
                  sciences that he thought it deserved. It should stand, as the noblest of the
                  scholarly disciplines, directly after theology, for its subject-matter is the
                  investigation of the greatest secrets of God’s creation. [...] A way the poeta
                  laureatus Maier found to bring Chymia nearer to the educated public was by
                  glorifying it in poetry. With this purpose he wrote not only three Latin poetic
                  cycles, but also his best-known work and certainly one of the most beautiful books
                  of alchemical literature of all time, the Atalanta fugiens, first printed in
                  1617.” In: <ref type="crossref" target="#figala_neumann1989">Figala and Neumann
                     1989</ref>, 49-50. Also, Principe: “In contrast to Basil Valentine’s organised
                  sequence of ‘keys’ that expound a single text and encode a single process, Maier’s
                  Atalanta fugiens is a florilegium of images. It collects imagery and expressions
                  from an array of earlier authors – Hermes, Morienus, Valentine, and others – and
                  assembles them into one of the most intricate and rich layerings of meaning to be
                  found in chymistry. Even though Maier probably did perform some laboratory work,
                  his Atalanta fugiens lies much further from the world of laboratory practice than
                  do the books of Valentine or George Starkey. (Some readers, including Sir Isaac
                  Newton, nevertheless mined it for practical information about making the
                  Philosophers’ Stone.)” In: <ref type="crossref" target="#principe2013">Principe
                     2013</ref>, 174.</note> In their introduction to <emph>Furnace and
               Fugue</emph>, Nummedal and Bilak state:<cit>
                  <quote>Maier [...] sought to elevate alchemy above its grubby artisanal roots,
                     establishing it as a humanist, philosophical, emblematic, courtly art with the
                     potential to access nature’s arcana. On this count <emph>Atalanta
                        fugiens</emph> certainly succeeds, demonstrating that alchemy offered not
                     just precious medicines or metals but also fodder for mathematical games,
                     musical riddles, artistic virtuosity, and classical erudition. (<ref target="#nummedal_bilak2020b">Nummedal and Bilak 2020b</ref>)</quote>
               </cit>
            </p>
            <p xml:id="p6">Some have even interpreted Maier’s <emph>Atalanta fugiens</emph> as a
               turn away from alchemical practice to the use of alchemical symbolism for poetic
               ends, merely repurposing existing material from earlier alchemical compendia as his
               poetic material (<ref type="crossref" target="#wels2010">Wels 2010</ref>, 2013).
               While claims have been made that <emph>Atalanta fugiens</emph> lacks practical
               chemistry, no detailed explanations are provided to support these assertions.<note xml:id="ftn13">Figala and Neumann conclude: “It has been said that this book
                  contains ‘no instructions at all for alchemical practice’. This is certainly true,
                  and much the same might be said about all Maier’s published works.” In: <ref type="crossref" target="#figala_neumann1989">Figala and Neumann 1989</ref>, 50.

                  eds.) titled Chemisches Wissen in Michael Maiers Atalanta fugiens.</note> Lawrence
               Principe characterises the work as follows: <cit>
                  <quote>It can thus be seen as part of the wider tradition of apologies of alchemy
                     in which Maier uses the poetry, music, learned play, and beautiful images of
                     his book to link chymistry to the liberal and the fine arts. His purpose, then,
                     is not simply to entertain readers but rather to ennoble a practice generally
                     considered dirty and laborious by making it attractive to humanist
                     contemporaries. [...] <emph>Atalanta fugiens</emph> is one instance of
                     continuing attempts to address chymistry’s shaky cultural and intellectual
                     position – an issue that plagued chymists from the Middle Ages through the
                     eighteenth century. (<ref type="crossref" target="#principe2013">Principe

               another. And, as the various contributions in <emph>Furnace and Fugue</emph> testify,
               there is still much left to be said about it.<note xml:id="ftn18">From a
                  historiographical standpoint, one may question the editors’ decision to re-edit
                  Maier’s most well-famous work when there would have been a large number of less
                  well researched works of Maier’s left that might have benefited more from in-depth
                  study. Especially as it seems likely that better knowledge of those works would be
                  critical for the interpretation of Atalanta fugiens, which – due to its highly
                  unusual nature – remains challenging to contextualise without deeper knowledge of
                  Maier’s other works.</note>

               such a multidisciplinary manner (<ref target="nummedal_bilak2020b">Nummedal and Bilak
                  2020b</ref>). <emph>Furnace and Fugue </emph>allows modern audiences, perhaps for
               the first time, to experience <emph>Atalanta fugiens</emph> in the way it may have
               been intended by the author. The editors state that De Jong’s fundamental 1969 study,
               which focused on source criticism, deflected attention from the unique multimedia
               combination that is <emph>Atalanta fugiens</emph>, reducing it to a traditionally
               text-centered approach. <emph>Furnace and Fugue</emph> aims fill this gap and explore
               neglected aspects, such as the relationships between images, texts, and music, in an
               interdisciplinary context ().  Additionally, the edition seeks to bridge the gap in
               knowledge between Maier’s intended audience, erudite Humanistic polymaths, and modern
               users. <emph>Furnace and Fugue</emph> makes Michael Maier’s unique multimedia emblem
               book more accessible in multiple ways: On the one hand, the scholarly articles
               addressing open questions of Maier research make this edition relevant for a
               scholarly audience (<ref type="crossref" target="#bianchi2020">Bianchi 2020</ref>;

                  </figure>The music notation present in <emph>Atalanta fugiens</emph> was encoded
                  using the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI), an XML standard for representing
                  musical documents. There likely must have been a music-historical interpretation
                  of the original scores as part of creating the edition, since the notes of the
                  digital edition are not the same as in the historical book. The Verovio-based MEI
                  viewer (<ref type="crossref" target="#img7">fig. 7</ref>) enables readers to play
                  and manipulate the music of the fugue by isolating certain voices (<ref target="#rashleigh_brusch2020">Rashleigh and Brusch 2020</ref>). The web MEI
                  player aims to engage musicologists and non-musicians alike, providing visual note
                  highlighting synchronised with the music playback. Users can isolate different
                  voices and utilise a piano roll visualisation to grasp the melodic and imitative
                  structures that constitute the fugues, which hold significance in relation to
                  Maier’s alchemical interpretation of his multimedia book. This approach allows
                  users who are less familiar with music notation and theory to comprehend the
                  ‘message’ and visual flow of the fugues, including the interrelationships between
                  different voices, as intended by Maier, who designed the music to add a layer of
                  dimension to his text so that readers could meditate on the musical theory in
                  conjunction with the text and emblematic images (<ref type="crossref" target="#img8">fig. 8</ref>). </p>
               <p xml:id="p14">The music notation was transcribed using the Sibelius software and
                  converted to MEI using the Sibelius-to-MEI plugin. Subsequently, the resulting
                  MEI/XML required adjustments for timing extraction using XSLT, which generated a
                  table of MEI elements and their respective timings using the Verovio JSNode
                  script. This step was necessary due to the inherent imprecision in human
                  musicians’ performances compared to the exactness of the music notation in
                  MEI/XML. To achieve smooth synchronisation between a viewer and a recording of
                  human voices based on ideal durations from the sheet music, data had to be adapted
                  to account for these discrepancies. Common Music Notation (CMN), an open-source
                  format for hierarchically describing and rendering musical scores as images, was
                  also created using Verovio on the command line. The Common Music Notation in SVG
                  and the MEI table with timings were then assembled and inserted into the HTML
                  template. Thus, “the project modernised the polyphonic fugues into animated
                  notation that is playable in a web browser” (<ref target="#rashleigh_brusch2020">Rashleigh and Brusch 2020</ref>).</p>

                     497-502. The translation from Mellon MS 48 seems to have been created soon
                     after the publication of Atalanta fugiens in 1617/18, as the watermarks
                     indicate the year 1625. The manuscript may have been intended as a draft for an
                     English edition, as indicated by corrections from an editor (<ref type="crossref" target="#leibenguth2002">Leibenguth 2002</ref>, 498). Sloane
                     Ms. 3645 from the British Library contains another English translation titled
                     The flying Atalanta. An alchemical treatise dated in the late 1670s. There are
                     at least two French translations, a 17th century exemplar at the Getty Research
                     Institute, Box 27, as well as an 18th century exemplar at Muséum d’histoire
                     naturelle (Paris), Ms. 360. A shortened version of Atalanta fugiens was
                     published under the title Scrutinium Chymicum in 1687. Furthermore, a 1708
                     edition called Chymisches Cabinet is the basis for <ref type="crossref" target="#hofmeier2007">Hofmeier 2007</ref> (with detailed indices). <ref type="crossref" target="#jong2002">Jong 2002</ref> also features an English

                     many translations and resources on Atalanta fugiens already existed may
                     indicate a missed opportunity to consolidate this material into one
                     comprehensive edition in Furnace and Fugue.</note> The TEI files contain

                  This makes the edition very user-friendly, intuitive, and ‘non-threatening’ to
                  users unfamiliar with edition practices and conventions. However, it has the
                  serious drawback of silently presenting the reader with a historical translation
                  without explicitly declaring it as such and which is made unrecognisable as such
                  at first glance because the normalised view is served to the readers by
                     default.<note xml:id="ftn29">Due to the choice of providing only historical
                     translations, there is, for example, no German view of the preface. In the
                     other cases where the ‘Diplomatic German’ version can be selected, only the
                     ‘Epigram’ is in German whereas the ‘Discourse’ remains in Latin, hinting at the
                     fact that ‘Diplomatic German’ means ‘diplomatic transcription of the German
                     edition’ (which happens to be bilingual) and does not necessarily describe the
                     language of the text itself. This is one of the other confusions caused by not
                     having included explanations on the translation in the edition view

               </head>
               <p xml:id="p20">Due to its beautiful design, accessibility, and the lasting
                  pop-cultural fascination of <emph>Atalanta fugiens</emph>, <emph>Furnace and
                     Fugue</emph> is likely to attract a non-scholarly audience, who may not be
                  aware of the potential pitfalls of re-using historical translations uncritically.
                  The way the anonymous 17th century English translation from Mellon MS 48 is
                  presented at this time, the historical translation is mostly in disguise: users
                  need to actively look for information on the provenance of the translation in
                  order to learn more about it. Most non-scholarly users of the edition are unlikely
                  to undertake this investigation. The fact that the translation is a historical
                  text of its own, requiring contextualisation, may even escape audiences who are
                  theoretically aware of these issues because it is disguised behind the normalised
                  reading version which appears as a default. </p>
               <p xml:id="p21">Early modern translations are liberal renderings rather than
                  trustworthy translations in our sense of the word. Translators are known to alter
                  meanings or details to accommodate their own interpretation of the source text or
                  alchemical theory – as Maier himself has done in his own vernacular-to-Latin
                  translation of Basil Valentine’s <emph>Twelve Keys </emph>(<ref type="crossref" target="#maier1618b">Maier 1618b</ref>; <ref type="crossref" target="#principe2013">Principe 2013</ref>, 153). Translations can be
                  influenced not only by the limitations of expressing certain concepts in exactly
                  the same way in multiple languages, but they can also be heavily influenced by the
                  authors’ own views, their time, cultural contexts, and their own interpretations
                  of the subject matter. Moreover, when historical translations are used without
                  extensive editing or commentary, readers who are not well-versed in the target
                  languages may overlook deficiencies in the translation. This is apparent, for
                  instance, in a 17th century English translation of Michael Maier’s
                     <emph>Viatorium</emph> (1618), where the translator evidently glossed over
                  portions they did not fully comprehend, without acknowledging their likely
                  uncertainty regarding the translation’s accuracy (<ref type="crossref" target="#mclean2005">McLean 2005</ref>). It is plausible that such a
                  translation represents an initial or rough draft, where the translator did not
                  invest significant time, effort, or care. Assessing the quality of such a
                  translation in detail is challenging without conducting a word-by-word translation
                  oneself. While a vague translation can offer readers an overview of the content of
                  a Latin work, it is important to recognise that it is likely to contain errors or
                  inaccuracies in the finer details. Many times, such historical translations,
                  instead of making the meaning easier to grasp for a modern reader, obscure it even
                  more, introducing additional room for misunderstandings of the message intended by
                  the original author. Even if the translation of <emph>Atalanta fugiens</emph> used
                  in <emph>Furnace and Fugue</emph> were substantially better than the
                  aforementioned example, it would still not be an ideal choice from a scholarly
                  standpoint and one would expect more critical engagement with this fact. In a
                  field like the historiography of alchemy, where details can be crucial, the use of
                  a potentially flawed 17th century translation is debatable to say the least,
                  particularly if it is not clearly declared as such.<note xml:id="ftn30">The
                     recommendations for editing early modern texts emphasise the importance of
                     carefully contextualising historical translations as independent historical
                     sources. While reusing historical translations may appear as a convenient
                     shortcut, it can be misleading. Editing historical translations requires
                     substantial effort when done correctly. The Neo-Latin community is divided on
                     whether to use historical translations at all, as their benefits may not
                     outweigh the potential challenges they present (<ref type="crossref" target="#mundt1992">Mundt 1992</ref>). After all, interpreting and
                     translating alchemical texts is and has always been a significant exegetical
                     endeavour, not only due to their specialist terms and ‘Decknamen’ but also
                     because certain words are generally hard to render in other languages without a
                     partial loss in meaning. Furthermore, the translator might not have understood
                     the original Latin or Maier’s intended alchemical message, for all we know. For
                     instance, in the Viatorium translation (<ref type="crossref" target="#mclean2005">McLean 2005</ref>) it is evident that the translator
                     uses formulations that obscure the meaning further when seemingly they did not
                     understand what Maier was talking about. However, instead of acknowledging this
                     uncertainty, as a modern editor would be expected to do, historical editors
                     often glossed over such issues. Therefore, the true benefit of reusing a
                     historical translation is questionable, and only individuals with sufficient
                     Latin skills to read Maier’s original text would be in a position to notice
                     such issues. This makes historical translations particularly unsuitable for lay
                     audiences, who would benefit the most from having a reliable translation
                     available.</note> </p>

                     information on why the authors think it to be a reliable translation. Was this
                     verified on a number of emblems or is there secondary literature to back this
                     claim up? Is there any reliable information on the production context and
                     intended use of Mellon MS 48? The English translation is based on the 17th
                     century translation Atalanta running, that is, new chymicall emblems relating
                     to the secrets of nature. Mellon MS 48. Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript

                  document which merits further research but also providing a reliable translation,
                  be reconciled? The editors encourage curious readers to explore the Beinecke
                  manuscript, but how can readers unfamiliar with textual criticism be expected to
                  make anything of this text without further contextualisation? Can a historical
                  document that merits further research ever be a reliable source, especially given
                  the complexities of alchemical language? This relatively uncritical engagement
                  with the source materials is a weakness of <emph>Furnace and Fugue</emph>. It is
                  an acceptable decision to not put special focus on the interpretation of the
                  Beinecke MS but it should at least have been contextualised in a way that makes
                  users of the edition aware of its nature and the problems this might entail. </p>
               <p xml:id="p23">To address this issue, an easy-to-find, clearly visible note should
                  be added to highlight the frequent unreliability of historical translations and
                  the reasons why they have to be used with caution. The lack of a critical edition
                  and the debatable use of a historical translation were also remarked upon in the
                  much shorter format of <emph>Reviews in DH </emph>(<ref type="crossref" target="#bielak2021">Bielak 2021</ref>).<note xml:id="ftn32">In this review,

                  As it stands, the translation might lead some to assume incorrectly that this
                  translation was produced throughout the <emph>Furnace and Fugue</emph> project
                  according to modern translation standards. The authors could have opted to present
                  the diplomatic translation as a default, as its wording immediately denotes it as
                  a historical document. A button to <lb/>‘Switch to reading version’ would make it
                  even more obvious. Alternatively, an information box could provide this vital
                  context and explain the implications for the translation’s accuracy and
                  trustworthiness.  A suggested citation could highlight the translation’s
                  provenance from a historical source. None of these issues is a dealbreaker and
                  they can be addressed through minor adjustments to the edition. I propose

               landscapes depicted in the background of Merian’s etchings, interpreting them as a
               commentary on the measurement of nature, thereby inviting users of the book to look
               more closely (<ref type="crossref" target="#gaudio2020">Gaudio 2020</ref>). Tara
               Nummedal interprets <emph>Atalanta fugiens</emph> as a reflection of Maier’s
               perspective on different types of reading (<ref type="crossref" target="#img17">fig.
                  17</ref> and <ref type="crossref" target="#img18">18</ref>): <emph>Atalanta
                  fugiens</emph> invites readers to engage in both the ‘horizontal mode’, i.e.
               quickly turning pages and viewing the emblems in context, but also the ‘vertical
               mode’ encouraging in-depth study of individual pages and thereby engaging different
               modes of meaning-making. The digital edition reflects this theory in the affordances
               it offers to its users (<ref type="crossref" target="#nummedal2020">Nummedal

            <p xml:id="p26">Richard Oosterhoff discusses allusions to mathematics such as the
               squaring of the circle in Maier’s earlier tract <emph>De Circulo Physico
                  Quadrato</emph> (1616), explaining it as a problem that cannot be solved by theory
               alone, but only by a practitioner able to combine ‘ratio’ and ‘experientia’<emph>,
               </emph>highlighting the importance of practical expertise alongside theory. Craftsmen
               are, as Maier suggests, ‘squaring circles’ all the time in their everyday practice by
               approximation while the problem remains unsolvable to theorists. Maier likely means
               to insinuate that the same is true for gold-making, framing it as a solution that is
               theoretically knowable, just not yet known, exactly like Aristotle had framed the
               squaring of the circle (<ref type="crossref" target="#oosterhoff2020">Oosterhoff
                  2020</ref>). Peter Forshaw discusses Maier’s mythoalchemy, comparing his
               mythoalchemical text <emph>Arcana Arcanissima</emph> (1614) with the mythoalchemical
               emblems of <emph>Atalanta fugiens</emph> (<ref type="crossref" target="#forshaw2020">Forshaw 2020</ref>). </p>

               </figure>The most groundbreaking revelation in <emph>Furnace and Fugue</emph> is that
               forty of the fifty fugues were copied from John Farmers <emph>Divers &amp; Sundry
                  Waies</emph> (1591), as Loren Ludwig demonstrates (<ref type="crossref" target="#ludwig2020">Ludwig 2020</ref>). Contrary to the original assumption that
               Maier composed most of the fugues himself, this discovery places <emph>Atalanta
                  fugiens</emph> in the reception line of an English crypto-catholic liturgical
               tradition but also raises questions about the role of the fugues in Maier’s overall
               work. While a crypto-catholic intention does not seem likely given Maier’s otherwise
               undoubtedly Lutheran faith, the reuse of those fugues underscores Maier’s belief in
               music as an alternative, yet equally suitable transmission medium for secret
               knowledge, be it spiritual or alchemical. Furthermore, Eric Bianchi suggests in his
               essay that <emph>Atalanta fugiens</emph> is unlikely to have been intended for
               performance but rather as an invitation to silent contemplation in the context of
               contemporary music theory – an ideal that Maier later realised in his
                  <emph>Cantilenae Intellectuales</emph> (1622). Bianchi further notes that
               composing music and possessing theoretical knowledge of music theory were markers of
               belonging to the courtly elite, the intended audience for Maier’s book, unlike
               playing music which was the task of skilled artisans (<ref type="crossref" target="#bianchi2020">Bianchi 2020</ref>). Nonetheless, <emph>Atalanta
                  fugiens</emph> can certainly be performed, as demonstrated by the music player in
               the digital edition and the performance edition (<ref type="crossref" target="#img19">fig. 19</ref>) created in the <emph>Furnace and Fugue</emph> project (<ref target="#nummedal_bilak2020a">Nummedal and Bilak 2020a</ref>).<note xml:id="ftn33">The music edition can be found under this: <ref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20231018103339/https:/furnaceandfugue.org/back-matter/music-performance/furnace-fugue-music-edition.pdf">https://furnaceandfugue.org/back-matter/music-performance/furnace-fugue-music-edition.pdf</ref>.

                  allow for the critical examination of sources, both primary sources and those
                  referenced in scholarly articles. Making it difficult or cumbersome to open up all
                  the footnotes, requiring individual clicks on each footnote, creates a user
                  experience that discourages active engagement with footnotes. A scholarly edition

               scholarly editions. It combines practices from both digital scholarly editions and
               digital scholarly publications, positioning itself as a first-born digital monograph

               making traditional scholarly peer-reviewed publications accessible as digital
               open-access editions while maintaining credibility within the traditional framework
               of tenure requirements. It does not directly derive from the Digital Humanities
               tradition of digital scholarly editing like it is usually reflected upon in reviews
               in this journal. This important information for understanding the institutional
               context of <emph>Furnace and Fugue</emph> can only be gleaned by listening to a
               number of podcasts, interviews, and online talks given by the editors and

               intriguing commentary on digital editions. On one hand, the project seeks to promote
               digital open-access publishing and align such publications with traditional academic
               expectations by partnering with a reputable publisher, the University of Virginia
               Press. This approach prioritises ‘extrinsic’<lb/>means of garnering reputation rather
               than fully utilising quality standards of the digital scholarly editing community,
               i.e., quality standards for digital editing as discussed frequently in this journal
               but that <emph>Furnace and Fugue </emph>does not make full use of (such as opting for
               the IconClass tagging system instead of a custom one to enhance interoperability or
               providing a critical edition of the text represented in the edition).<note xml:id="ftn41">It is worth discussing briefly why this may present problems. Does
                  a digital edition only hold value if it receives approval from a traditional
                  press? Does this impose further restrictions on scholars engaged in scholarly
                  editing? The involvement of a tenured professor at Brown University, along with
                  the support of the Mellon Foundation and Brown Digital Publishing Initiative,
                  highlights the privilege associated with such projects. Does this potentially set
                  a precedent for other scholars interested in publishing digitally, requiring them
                  to collaborate with prestigious presses, a practice rather uncommon in the world
                  of digital scholarly editing? Does this implicitly suggest that a digital edition
                  itself is not a reputable or serious publication? In fact, the digital scholarly
                  editing community offers various quality assurance measures, both ‘extrinsic’
                  (such as this journal or the Reviews in DH journal), and ‘intrinsic’ by adhering
                  to best practices in digital scholarly editing. These measures are intended to
                  ensure quality assurance and prevent digital editions from being perceived as
                  inferior to traditional print editions.Such concerns may have been understandable
                  at a time when digital scholarly editing was less prevalent and online sources
                  still carried a stench of untrustworthiness. However, one would expect that in
                  2020, a year where the necessity of ‘going digital’ became even more evident in
                  academia, even in previously less digital spaces due to the global pandemic, this
                  would no longer be a topic of discussion. As a member of the Digital Humanities
                  community, one would assume that a digital edition is not viewed as inferior, even
                  in the initial years of the project (2015/7). If anything, participating in or
                  leading a digital project should be considered an asset for one’s Curriculum
                  Vitae, as indicated in the podcasts where the editors discuss the motivation
                  behind Furnace and Fugue (<ref type="crossref" target="#newbooksnetwork2020">New
                     Books Network 2020</ref>, <ref type="crossref" target="#cocks2021">Cocks
                     2021</ref>). Then again, this might serve to put into relief the contrast which
                  still exists between the Digital Humanities and more traditionally-minded scholars
                  with regards to digital scholarly editing. Admittedly, these statements were only
                  made in more informal outlets such as interviews or podcasts, not reflected in the
                  narrative on the website itself. However, it remains crucial to pay close
                  attention to the rhetoric employed in digital edition projects, particularly those
                  claiming to serve as flagship examples for inspiring future best
               practices.</note> </p>
            <p xml:id="p39">However, the self-fashioning of the project as a digital publishing
               pioneer may be explained by the unmentioned focus on creating a digital publication,
               that is a digitally-enhanced, peer-reviewed, open-access edited collection rather
               than a digital scholarly edition of <emph>Atalanta fugiens</emph> itself. While these
               decisions are valid, they could have been explicitly stated in the project
               description. Given the project’s aim to develop high-quality digital publications
               deserving the same respect as print equivalents, it still seems a bit unusual that
               more interest was not extended to the digital scholarly edition of <emph>Atalanta
                  fugiens</emph>. The methodology of scholarly editing, digital or otherwise, has
               long been accepted as a means of ensuring quality and reputation for text editions.
               The title of the digital publication “a Digital Edition [...] with Scholarly
               Commentary” (<ref target="#nummedal_bilak2020b">Nummedal and Bilak 2020b</ref>),
               though probably carefully chosen, may be considered somewhat misleading since
               scholars trained in text editing or textual philology would expect that commentary to
               relate directly to the text. According to a more traditional definition of a
               scholarly commentary, the articles provide inter- and multidisciplinary
               interpretations of <emph>Atalanta fugiens</emph>, not a commentary of the text
               itself. The title of the introduction, “Interplay. New Scholarship on <emph>Atalanta
                  fugiens</emph>” (), confirms just that suspicion – that <emph>Furnace and
                  Fugue</emph> is not primarily a digital scholarly edition of <emph>Atalanta
                  fugiens</emph> but rather, provides new scholarship on <emph>Atalanta
                  fugiens</emph> while at the same time making the text and facsimiles easily
               accessible online.</p>

         <div xml:id="div9">
            <head>Furnace and Fugue as a digital edition</head>
            <p xml:id="p40">The editors emphasise the fact that <emph>Furnace and Fugue</emph> is
               the first truly interdisciplinary resource on <emph>Atalanta fugiens</emph>, yet, its
               unique contribution pertains mainly to the area of musicology. This is reflected both
               in the edition of the source text itself, featuring an innovative MEI Viewer/Player,
               which allows even a lay audience to playfully explore the musical composition, and in
               the scholarly essays, which contribute consequential new insights mostly with regard
               to Maier’s fugues. While the other essays explore interesting aspects, they do not
               fundamentally change our understanding of <emph>Atalanta fugiens</emph> but rather
               expand on existing discussions. The team was certainly interdisciplinary, yet as to
               the pertinent question of why there was not a historian of chemistry involved, the
               project website remains silent.<note xml:id="ftn42">Historians of chemistry, such as
                  Lawrence Principe, seem to have acted as consultants at some stage of the project
                  or at least participated in the 2015 and 2016 workshops. This criticism may have
                  been anticipated and thus addressed with an explanation as to why the decision was
                  made to not include such a central aspect.</note> </p>
            <p xml:id="p41">Despite its other merits, which are plentiful, <emph>Furnace and
                  Fugue</emph> could have done a better job of being more critical of its sources
               (the 17th century translation) and tailoring the resource for the needs of a
               scholarly audience (making footnotes more easily accessible in the scholarly essays).
               It is suggested that a note regarding the translation as well as a ‘show all
               footnotes’ button should be added to remedy these issues. As a third main issue, the
               long-term archiving situation is not clear and there is no statement on the data
               management plan.</p>
            <p xml:id="p42">While <emph>Furnace and Fugue</emph> excels in visual presentation and
               interactive aspects, it falls short in textual criticism as it lacks a critical
               edition. While it is understandable that <emph>Furnace and Fugue</emph> opted to
               focus on aspects previous editions had paid less attention to (images and music), the
               text is still one of the three core elements of Maier’s multimedia work (text, image,
               music). Despite the significant scholarly interest in <emph>Atalanta fugiens</emph>,
               the text itself remains incompletely understood, lacking a commentary or
               comprehensive textual analysis. The absence of a critical edition or deeper
               engagement with the text is regrettable and leaves a sense of incompleteness.
               However, this was a deliberate decision by the editors, who have successfully
               achieved the goals they set for this digital edition of <emph>Atalanta
               fugiens</emph>. </p>

               </figure>Classifying <emph>Furnace and Fugue</emph> as a digital scholarly edition is
               somewhat challenging since it does not provide a critical edition of <emph>Atalanta
                  fugiens</emph> per se, although it does offer scholarly essays on the subject.
               Thus, one could say that it meets the criteria of being both a digital edition and a
               scholarly resource. The map included in Tilton’s introduction, for instance, does a
               convincing job of visualising Maier’s travels, however, this particular feature does
               not truly lose its usefulness when given in print form (<ref type="crossref" target="#img23">fig. 23</ref>). Then again, Digital Humanities scholars are
               probably not the primary target audience, as certain notable features, such as the
               ability to create personal emblem collections and interactive rearrangement, are not
               highlighted in the documentation as the noteworthy features they are. <emph>Furnace
                  and Fugue </emph>includes interactive digital features that cannot be replicated
               in print, suggesting its classification as a digital scholarly edition.<note xml:id="ftn43">On criteria for classifying resources as digital scholarly
                  editions: <ref type="crossref" target="#sahle2016">Sahle 2016</ref>.</note> </p>
            <p xml:id="p44">Potential future work for <emph>Furnace and Fugue </emph>includes
               integrating the image search with Emblematica Online or similar sources. This would
               entail tagging the images according to the IconClass guidelines for easier comparison
               of potential visual inspirations. The text could benefit from a philological approach
               and a text-critical edition, providing explanations of visual motifs and sources
               directly on the text in the form of a traditional commentary. Having to retrieve and
               reassemble the information scattered throughout scholarly essays makes it hard to
               form one’s own interpretation of the text. Additionally, integrating the sources
               identified by De Jong or providing an easily searchable overview of De Jong’s
               findings would be valuable (<ref type="crossref" target="#jong2002">Jong 2002</ref>,
               330-33), maybe even linking to the sources of relevant facsimiles available online.
               Further research could explore the chemical interpretations of <emph>Atalanta
                  fugiens</emph>, as done in Werthmann.<note xml:id="ftn44">

            <p xml:id="p45">While <emph>Furnace and Fugue</emph> has a beautifully designed layout
               and a collaboration with a traditional publishing house, it could enhance the user
               experience by providing more transparent information about its sources, such as the
               17th century English translation, and improving the accessibility of footnotes in
               scholarly essays. While the resource offers diplomatic and normalised transcriptions
               of the Latin-German original book and its 17th century English translation, textual
               scholars may desire a critical apparatus or commentary at the word or sentence level.
               The scholarly essays provide interpretations but do not constitute a philological or
               text-critical edition as implied by the project title. </p>
            <p xml:id="p46">Additionally, the long-term archiving situation and data management plan
               require clarification. The insights gained from the project should be published in a
               Digital Humanities publication to make them accessible to the wider community and
               ensure preservation for the future, involving both the editors as well as the
               technical leads of the project.  Such a publication could summarise some of the
               information which can now be found by listening to a number of podcasts on the
               project but also explain decisions made in the process of creating this publication
               in more detail, especially with regards to experimenting with ways to handle the
               multimediality of the sources, potential reuse scenarios (and a long-term archiving
               plan) for the data and libraries created for the project. Furthermore, it would be
               great to have a deeper description of the digital aspects of the project which goes
               beyond the brief project description (backmatter/about). Overall, <emph>Furnace and
                  Fugue</emph> is a stunning project that provides a valuable platform for both the
               general public and scholars to explore <emph>Atalanta fugiens</emph>.</p>

            <head>Conclusion</head>
            <p xml:id="p47">
               <emph>Furnace and Fugue</emph> is the first born-digital monograph by Brown
               University Digital Publications, consisting of eight interpretative essays, three
               introductory texts, and a digital edition of the early modern emblem book
                  <emph>Atalanta fugiens</emph> (1618a), including a MEI-based music player, using
               which individual voices can be isolated for analysis and demonstration, an invaluable
               feature for lectures or educational presentations. The edition shines in its elegant
               visual presentation and interactive capabilities. For instance, the feature to create
               personalised emblem collections is significant, allowing focused, individualised
               study. Additionally, the image search functionality lets users dive deeply into the
               material, even if it could benefit from integration into existing emblem databases
               and search engines to facilitate even broader comparative studies. Particularly
               noteworthy is the innovative MEI Viewer/Player, which opens new vistas for
               understanding Maier’s intricate fusion of music with alchemical thought, allowing
               even those without a music theory background to engage deeply with the fugues. The
               feature not only empowers academic scrutiny but also extends the project’s appeal to
               a broader audience.</p>
            <p xml:id="p48">A flagship project and ‘haute couture’ digital edition, <emph>Furnace
                  and Fugue</emph> pushes the boundaries of multimedia publication in the
               historiography of alchemy. Nummedal and Bilak have seamlessly blended the realms of
               digital scholarly edition and digital scholarly publication, with the edition being
               accompanied by essays from various disciplines. In the context of alchemy research,
               where digital scholarly editions are still relatively few, <emph>Furnace and
                  Fugue</emph> is an innovative project, taking its place alongside the only two
               other major digital editions, the 2009 pioneering <emph>Chymistry of Isaac
                  Newton</emph> project (<ref type="crossref" target="#newman2009">Newman
               2009</ref>) and the influential <emph>Making and Knowing</emph> project (2014-2021,
                  <ref type="crossref" target="#smith2020">Smith 2020</ref>). The comprehensive and
               interactive digital platform realises the multimedia experience likely envisioned by
               Maier for <emph>Atalanta fugiens</emph>, a feature hitherto inaccessible to most
               users of the book. In sum, <emph>Furnace and Fugue</emph> enriches scholarship on
               early modern alchemy and on the chymist Michael Maier. It sets a precedent in its
               multidisciplinary approach and multimedia digital edition. It represents a
               significant leap forward in understanding Maier’s multimedia vision and its
               implications for his alchemical thought.</p>
