               <emph>Decameron Web</emph> (DW) offers an online digital edition of Boccaccio’s
                  <emph>Decameron</emph> both in Italian and English language. It is a comprehensive
               information portal about the Decameron and the cultural, historical context of the
               time in which it was written. Thanks to its high usability and consolidated
               sustainability, DW has reached sufficient maturity and consistency to be a valuable
               resource for research. Nonetheless, the technological methods adopted for the
               encoding, exploration, and visualisation of the text should undergo major
               improvements in order to consider DW as a state-of-the-art scholarly digital edition
               (SDE). The author describes and evaluates DW from a philological and methodological
               point of view. After a general introduction, the author goes into more detail on the
               subject and content of the project, focusing on the aims and methods pursued during
               its realization. Particular attention is devoted to the quality of the presentation
               of the edition. The description of the edition’s main features is supported by some
               personal suggestions for improvement.</p>

               is a project-focused online edition of Boccaccio’s <emph>Decameron</emph>. It has
               been realized by the Virtual Humanities Lab of the Italian Studies Department at
               Brown University.<note xml:id="ftn2">On the bottom of DW’s home page, the expressions
                  ‘Italian Studies Department’, ‘Virtual Humanities’ and ‘Brown University’ are
                  hyperlinks to the webpage of the Brown University’s Italian Studies Department,
                  the Virtual Humanities Lab (VHL) and the Brown University, respectively.</note>
               The project offers an Italian and an English version of the Decameron, including over
               300 documents and dozens of images for the study of the text. DW was originally
               conceived as a “participatory hypertext project used to teach the Decameron” (<ref type="crossref" target="#brownuniversity">Brown University n.d.</ref>), started
               between 1994 and 1995, and it still considers itself as a learning resource. It
               attempts to provide a 360-degree educational experience of the Decameron to a wide
               and various audience, by adopting an interdisciplinary perspective. In the
               presentation of the project, it is stated:<cit>
                  <quote>Through a creative use of technology, our project provides the reader with
                     an easily accessible and flexible yet well-structured wealth of information on
                     the literary, historical and cultural context of the <emph>Decameron</emph>,
                     thus allowing a vivid yet rigorously philological understanding of the past in
                     which the work was conceived. </quote>

            <p xml:id="p2">The general parameters followed in the realization of the project are
               easily accessible. This review will discuss whether these self-imposed principles
               have been respected and, using RIDE’s <emph>Criteria for Reviewing Scholarly Digital
                  Editions</emph> as a reference (<ref type="crossref" target="#sahle2014">Sahle
                  2014</ref>), I will determine whether DW can be considered a proper scholarly
               digital edition. It is important to notice that DW does not state anywhere that it is
               intended to function as a digital scholarly edition: hence, this review is testing it
               for a scenario for which DW might not have been originally intended. Nonetheless,
               educational resources need to fulfil many of the requirements of digital editions,
               especially if they are intended for use at university.</p>
            <p xml:id="p3">From the very beginning, the responsible co-editors of the project have
               been Massimo Riva, professor of Italian Studies at Brown University, Providence and
               Michael Papio, professor of Italian Studies at the University of Massachusetts,
               Amherst. Information about the other directors, the project staff, the Editorial and
               Advisory Board are included in the section ‘Project’ of the website. DW received
               funds for the development by the National Endowment for the Humanities’ two-year
               grants. An important event that marked the historical evolution of the project was
               ‘The Boccaccio AfterLife Prize for Best Translation and Adaptation of a Decameron
               novella into any Media’, an award won in 2013 that brought new updates to the
                  project.<note xml:id="ftn3">‘The Boccaccio AfterLife Prize for Best Translation
                  and Adaptation of a Decameron novella into any Media’ was a prize awarded by
                  Decameron Web, Brown University in collaboration with the Italian Consulate
                  General in Boston, Massachusetts and the Ente Nazionale Giovanni Boccaccio of
                  Certaldo, Italy to celebrate the 700th anniversary of Giovanni Boccaccio’s birth
                  and the year of Italian Culture in the United States.

            <p xml:id="p4">Considering the fast evolution of technologies in the digital world, the
               fact that the website is still alive and growing in terms of content, thanks to the
               collaboration between the creators and the users, could surprise at first. However,
               it should be remarked that the technologies adopted are extremely simple. The text of
               the Decameron contains PHP hyperlinks that allow jumping from the English to the
               Italian version and vice versa. An XML encoding of the text is not available, hence
               it is not possible to see which tags are used to enrich the text. Image-based
               resources are generally included in JPG format and do not adopt any particular
               standard for digital images, such as the IIIF technology.<note xml:id="ftn4">URL to
                  the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF): <ref target="https://iiif.io/">https://iiif.io/</ref> (Accessed January 16,
                  2021).</note> These are just a few examples showing that, on the one hand, the
               project maintenance is currently not heavily endangered by complex technologies, but
               on the other hand, the technologies used are often no longer up-to-date.</p>

               </figure> Given the long history of the project, continuous updates have been
               necessary. On the home page of the website, users are told that “the updates are
               complete” (<ref type="crossref" target="#brownuniversityitalianstudies1995">Brown
                  University 1995</ref>). However, no date of the last modification is specified
               here, which would be useful, whereas specific updates are indicated at the bottom of
               each section of the website. The last update that can be retrieved, under the
               sections “Syllabus” and “Pedagogy”, was done in 2018 (see <ref type="crossref" target="#img1">Fig. 1</ref>).</p>
            <p xml:id="p6">As a learning resource, DW is not restricted to the academic field; it
               offers educational material for teachers, besides being a useful tool for students
               and a source of knowledge for any passionate reader of Boccaccio. Therefore, its
               target audience is made of “students, teachers, scholars and readers of the
                  <emph>Decameron</emph>” (<ref type="crossref" target="#brownuniversityitalianstudies1995">Brown University 1995</ref>). In terms
               of usability, DW is suitable for all of them.</p>
            <p xml:id="p7">The project offers a great variety of external resources reachable from
               the website, avoiding to overload the website with information that already exists.
               Links to external resources are disseminated throughout DW, according to their
               content and the reason why they have been included. There is a network of hyperlinks
               to resources managed by Brown University, such as the pages of <emph>
                  <ref target="https://www.brown.edu/">The Sheridan Center</ref>

               sections within the website: words identifying other sections are serving as
               hyperlinks to that section. Finally, an extensive bibliography is provided both for
               the website at large and for its individual sections. DW makes wide-ranging and
               efficient use of linked resources.</p>

            <p xml:id="p8">Although already rich in content and functions, DW presents itself as a
               growing reference resource for scholars of the Decameron. The selection of the
               material is based on the motivation of reaching a wide audience who can be interested
               in different aspects of the work. The variety of sources and documents is declared in

                     includes the text in its established critical edition (Branca), sources,
                     translations, annotations and commentaries, bibliographies, a growing selection

               medieval text to the project’s main audience: high school teachers and students.
               Whether the paratext was excluded from the website for this reason or not, certainly
               the lack of inclusion of the critical apparatus of both the Italian and English
               version of the Decameron means that the text presented is ultimately incomplete. By
               comparing the Italian version of the Decameron in DW with Branca's referenced printed
               edition, some sparse errors can be detected in the former, supposedly mainly due to
               transcription errors.<note xml:id="ftn7">Some of the errors found in DW compared to

            <p xml:id="p12">Moreover, it should be remarked that the text chosen for the Italian
               version is not the most recent existing critical edition of Boccaccio’s Decameron. A
               new edition of the work, edited by Giancarlo Alfano, Maurizio Fiorilla and Amedeo
               Quondam, has been published by the Biblioteca Universale Rizzoli (BUR) in 2013.<note xml:id="ftn8">Hereinafter referred to as the Fiorilla edition.</note> Both
               Fiorilla’s and Branca’s editions are based on the Hamilton 90. However, according to
               Fiorilla (<ref type="crossref" target="#boccaccio2013">Decameron, 2013</ref>), as
               explained in the introductory notes to the text, the comparative analysis of the
               three most reliable witnesses of the Decameron, which are the Hamilton 90 (B), the
               Parigino Italiano 482 (P) and the Laurenziano Plut. XLII 1 (MN), led him to make some
               changes to Branca’s edition. The changes concern several readings, some printing
               errors, punctuation, the adoption of the form ‘sè’ rather than the usual ‘se’ as the
               second singular person of present indicative of the verb ‘to be’. Besides, Fiorilla
               decided to reproduce in part the graphic system of capital letters used by Boccaccio,
               which is represented in the Hamilton 90, to catch the reader’s attention in specific
               moments of the narration.<note xml:id="ftn9">Given that Fiorilla’s 2013 edition of
                  the Decameron represents the most recent critical edition available and given the
                  significant modifications compared to Branca’s 1992 edition and its reliability, I
                  would suggest using Fiorilla’s as the reference print edition for possible future
                  updates of the Decameron Web.</note>
            </p>
            <p xml:id="p13">In terms of the structural organisation of the text, the Decameron’s
               structure resembles a series of frames that merge into each other; the external
               narrator tells the reader about ten internal narrators who in turn tell stories that
               occasionally contain characters who tell stories. To navigate the text, DW gives the
               possibility to choose, first, among ‘Proem’, ‘First Day’ to ‘Tenth Day’, ‘Author’s
               Epilogue’. Then, while the ‘Proem’ and the ‘Author’s Epilogue’ do not present further
               nested levels, each of the ten days presents the same nested structure: an
               ‘Introduction’, ‘Novel I’ to ‘Novel X’, and a ‘Conclusion’.</p>

               <p xml:id="p18"> DW goes beyond the creation of an online edition focused on the
                  Italian version and English translation of Boccaccio’s masterpiece: the editors
                  intend to give the user the possibility to reach a thorough grasp of the work by
                  exploring other fields of study. Massimo Riva recognizes that the nature of the
                  Decameron is itself multidisciplinary: “The <emph>Decameron</emph> defined the
                  standard of Italian prose narrative for four centuries and deeply influenced
                  Renaissance drama. It is also a goldmine for information about everyday life in
                  the late Middle Ages.” (<ref type="crossref" target="#brownuniversityitalianstudies1995">Brown University 1995</ref>).
                  Starting from this assumption, an interesting parallel is drawn between the past
                  and the present. In the general introduction to the project, we read:<cit>

                        repertory of perennially human situations and dilemmas: it is the perfect
                        subject for an experiment in a new form of scholarly and pedagogical
                        communication aimed at renewing a living dialogue between a distant past and
                        our present. </quote>

                  </figure> DW does not provide amendments to the text of the Decameron, nor a
                  different type of edition. Regarding textual criticism, while the project provides
                  a detailed description of each manuscript cited as a resource on the website, an
                  overall explication of Decameron’s textual tradition is missing. The difficulties
                  around the definition of Decameron’s textual tradition cannot be neglected.
                  Although we possess an autograph of the author (Hamilton 90, datable 1370), we
                  know that the Decameron was written before and with considerable differences.
                  Moreover, most of the witnesses of the work are lost. Establishing a <emph>stemma
                     codicum</emph> is not an easy attempt; nevertheless, both Fiorilla (<ref type="crossref" target="#img5">Fig. 5</ref>) and Branca (<ref type="crossref" target="#img6">Fig. 6</ref>) drew their hypotheses. Some explicative
                  information shedding light on this situation could be included under the option
                  ‘Texts’ or ‘Literature’, making it directly accessible to the user who is

                  </figure>In collaboration with the Brown University Scholarly Technology Group
                  (STG), the original HTML version of the Decameron was initially encoded using
                  SGML, served by the Dynaweb software. The DTD schema created by STG was based on
                  TEI-Lite, a specific customization of the TEI tagset. Both, the English and the
                  Italian versions of the Decameron, as well as the text of <emph>Corbaccio</emph>
                  and <emph>Elegia a Madonna Fiammetta</emph>, have been converted from SGML to XML.
                  Information concerning the encoding is quite poor. Besides the specification of
                  the schema that was used, the project does not provide any formal documentation of
                  the data modeling adopted, nor the possibility to retrieve the XML encoding. By
                  exploring the ‘Texts’ section, it can be deduced that the text of the Decameron
                  was organized in structural units, such as whole text, frame,
                  <emph>novella</emph>. Inside these, named characters and geographic locations were
                  tagged and identified through attributes useful for scholarly research and
                  teaching, compliant with the scope of the project. However currently, it is not
                  possible to access these elements interactively from within the text itself.
                  Additionally, labels are used to identify the portions of the text and the voice
                  of who is telling that part of the story. As for the portions of the text,
                  clickable numbers easily allow switching to the page with the text in the other
                  language. Labels can be hidden (see <ref type="crossref" target="#img7">Fig.
                     7</ref>). This labelling strategy allows the user to jump from the Italian to
                  the English version at any point in the text. Finally, metadata is used to
                  classify secondary sources and interlinkage is provided between the text and the
                  resource materials.</p>

                  All the options for research on the website are displayed on the home page and
                  menu on the left of each other page. The same standard structure is adopted for
                  every page of the website. On the top right there is the Google search function,
                  which works efficiently. This search function is case-insensitive. To navigate
                  through the text of the Decameron, the user has to go to the ‘Texts’ section,
                  choose the language version and then select the portion of the text from two
                  drop-down menus, one for the <emph>Giornata</emph> and one for the
                     <emph>Novella</emph>. The user can easily navigate on the website and inside
                  the text, being constantly aware of the content currently displayed and of its
                  position in the overall architecture of the website (see <ref type="crossref" target="#img8">Fig. 8</ref>).</p>
               <p xml:id="p23">The interface of the edition is extremely simple and intuitive. The
                  first impression is that the website was created a long time ago. A great effort
                  has been made at modernising it, as explicitly declared in the page of the Brown
                  University’s Center for Digital Scholarship: “In 2009 and 2010, the Decameron Web
                  was redesigned and updated to have a more contemporary look, to conform to current
                  HTML standards, and to work with updated HTML technologies such as javascript.”
                  (Brown University, n.d.). However, since 2009 a decade has passed, and the
                  interface could be made more modern and attractive. Nevertheless, the website
                  works and has already proven to be able to readapt to the technological changes of
                  the digital world, suggesting good prospects for long-term use.</p>
               <p xml:id="p24">To guarantee DW’s sustainability, a plan for the long-term
                  preservation of the website is urgently necessary. Besides, the possibility to
                  access at least the XML files of the Decameron should be granted. In terms of
                  future development, there is only a reference to the project’s contents, not to
                  the technologies adopted, nor to the methods employed for the data storage, as
                  stated in the section ‘The Project’: “This collection of materials will continue
                  to grow in years to come, as students and scholars at Brown University and other
                  institutions contribute syllabi, successful teaching strategies, new essays,
                  interpretations, images, and so forth” (<ref type="crossref" target="#brownuniversityitalianstudies1995">Brown University 1995</ref>). The
                  lack of information concerning plans for the website’s preservation and where and
                  how data is stored makes it difficult to assess the DW’s sustainability.</p>
               <p xml:id="p25">In terms of usability, the project could attempt to provide the user
                  with both the Italian and English versions of all the contents. At the moment, it
                  is not possible to choose on the home page which language version should be used
                  for the entire website; the main language is English and, except for the text of
                  the Decameron, only a few sections offer the option of switching to Italian. For
                  instance, for the two texts <emph>Corbaccio</emph> and <emph>Elegia di Madonna
                     Fiammetta</emph>, an additional menu giving the possibility to change the
                  language could be included, as it is already available for the other textual
                  resources. Indeed, the current button intended for this function does not work
                  properly: once clicked, it redirects to the page containing the text of the
                  Decameron. Since this very probably disorientates some users, I would suggest
                  deactivating or removing the button as long as the English versions of
                     <emph>Corbaccio</emph> and <emph>Elegia</emph> are not present. Assuming that
                  the main community for Decameron studies is Italophone, making available both the
                  languages for each page would increase the usability of the website and open it up
                  to a wider audience.</p>

                  authentication. The online digital edition with all its functions is suitable for
                  a mobile device. On the website, there is a strong invitation for users to give

                  the graph covers a period that is relatively short and distant from today, between
                  1994 and 2002. To provide reliable data, the graph should be constantly updated,
                  or replaced by more elaborate parameters. Updates could also be implemented on
                  some other incorrect information emerging during the website navigation. For

            <head>Conclusion</head>
            <p xml:id="p31">The description and evaluation of DW realized in this review have
               revealed some issues concerning its conformity with the principles of the “digital
               paradigm” (<ref type="crossref" target="#sahle2016">Sahle 2016, 26-27</ref>)<note xml:id="ftn19">“It can be said that digital editions follow a <emph>digital
                     paradigm</emph>, just as printed editions have been following a paradigm that
                  was shaped by the technical limitations and cultural practices of typography and
                  book printing” (<ref type="crossref" target="#sahle2016">Sahle 2016,
                  26-27</ref>).</note> and therefore, its classification as a scholarly digital
               edition. According to Sahle, the digital paradigm consists of a series of principles,
               such as hypertextuality, multimediality, transmediality, modularity and fluidity.</p>
            <p xml:id="p32">The many resources used on the website and the representation of the
               text do not reflect an organisation of the edition into multiple layers of textual
               representation originating from the same abstract modeling of the text. Hence, the
               facilitation of the multiple texts on the theoretical, methodological and practical
               level and the “multipurpose representations” which characterize “the shift from media
               orientation to data orientation” (<ref type="crossref" target="#sahle2016">Sahle
                  2016, 32</ref>) that, according to Patrick Sahle, represents the real revolution
               of the digital paradigm, is not achieved.</p>
            <p xml:id="p33">In general, the potential of a digitally encoded text, distinguishing a
               digital edition from a mere digitised text, is not fully exploited. DW uses a printed
               edition as the reference text for the digital online edition but lacks the inclusion
               of paratextual information. The XML encoding used to model the text is not available
               to the user, the search functions do not work and the indexes are given as static pdf
               pages, organised alphabetically. The mark up of the text only encompasses names and
               numbers in order to switch between languages; the user cannot visualise the text in
               both languages in parallel, nor visualise the text accompanied by the image of the
               manuscript in parallel, which is a common feature among other SDEs.<note xml:id="ftn20">See URL to <emph>Jane Austen’s Fiction Manuscripts</emph>: <ref target="http://www.janeausten.ac.uk/index.html">http://www.janeausten.ac.uk/index.html</ref> (Accessed March 27, 2021), URL to

                  (Accessed March 27, 2021).</note> Overall, the encoded text does not offer
               different views and presentations of the text. A printed edition of the DW would not
               result in a significant loss in contents and functionality, apart from its
               hypertextuality, which is indeed inherently digital. A synoptic edition with the
               Italian text on one side and the English one on the other, further enriched with the
               critical apparatus, would certainly be more informative.</p>
            <p xml:id="p34">Moving on to Sahle’s principles and, specifically, to the principle of
               fluidity, the edition as a publication is rather static, fixed on a distinct moment
               of publication and based on a single (and not the most recent) edition of the text.
               DW conveys the idea of the Decameron as a finished product rather than as an ongoing
               process. Despite the inclusion of a variety of contextual material, some important
               editorial information, such as the critical apparatus and a reflection over the
               problems concerning the text’s tradition, is missing. Therefore, improvements could
               be done to obtain a more modularised structure of DW as well. It cannot be said that
               the hyperlinks employed restructure the contents of the edition; they rather offer a
               way to reach useful resources enriching these contents. As for multimediality, the
               website offers a multitude of different media to experience the text from a variety
               of perspectives; however, these media are not wholly integrated within the text,
               remaining mere links to other pages.</p>
            <p xml:id="p35">Given all the considerations above, DW does not seem to fully conform to
               digital scholarly standards, nor does it fulfil the digital paradigm as defined by
               Patrick Sahle. Therefore, it can hardly be considered as a state-of-the-art SDE at
               the moment. Having said that, the current evaluation could surely be re-discussed
               after the architecture of the edition has been improved.</p>
            <p xml:id="p36">Nonetheless, some positive aspects are worth mentioning. DW is very open
               to changes and encourages active use. It invites not only current collaborators but
               any user to contribute to the project by sharing their knowledge and suggestions. The
               multiple aims and the interdisciplinary nature of the edition, self-stated in the
               project’s aims, are fully achieved. The project’s creative and pedagogical use of
               technology aiming at delivering an “educational experience based on a literary text
               that is open to a variety of cultural interests and levels of learning” (<ref type="crossref" target="#brownuniversityitalianstudies1995">Brown University
                  1995</ref>) is stated and fully fulfilled. Each new content is provided with a
               technical and detailed explanation of its features and an extensive bibliography,
               providing the user with a critical understanding of both the Decameron and the
               context in which it was written.</p>
            <p xml:id="p37">In terms of usability, every aspect of DW is carefully considered and
               explicitly explained, taking into account the type of audience, their level of
               knowledge of the Decameron and possible issues they can encounter on the website. In
               this way, the edition becomes easily accessible even for a non-specialized user.
               Nonetheless, the organisation of the contents is not very intuitive. It could be
               improved by making a clearer distinction between the edition itself, commentary and
               apparatus sections and related resources, and by reducing redundancy. Extra value
               could be added to DW by making the graphic visualisation of the Decameron’s autograph
               Hamilton 90 through pictures directly available and by updating the referential print
               edition with the most recent existing one. These changes could also make DW better
               suited to an academic audience. Nevertheless, DW offers a huge quantity of contents
               and functionalities of high academic quality, thanks to the project staff’s constant
               effort to provide updated and reliable content.</p>
            <p xml:id="p38">Some other technological improvements could be made to DW, such as
               allowing for the parallel visualisation of the text in the two languages, making the
               XML encoding available and rendering some contents such as maps and indexing options
               interactive. Contents should be better integrated with the text and the interface
               should undergo a process of modernisation. These changes would bring DW closer to
               state-of-the-art scholarly digital editions. Having said that, it should be
               remembered that DW was not originally intended as a scholarly digital edition, but
               rather as a mini-library, a sort of encyclopaedia of information concerning
               Boccaccio’s masterpiece. In this sense, it is undeniable that DW fully accomplished
               its original educational purpose. Ultimately, it is extraordinary that this edition
               started at the end of the last century is still available online.</p>
