            <p>The Hypertext Stack Project (confessio.ie), which digitizes Bieler’s 1950/51 print
               edition of Patrick of Ireland’s letters, is one of few critical digital editions in
               classical scholarship. Hence, besides supplying much supporting material such as
               translations or images of manuscripts, it aims to serve as a model for digitally
               editing (late) ancient texts. Confessio.ie succeeds at showing that TEI can be
               applied to classical texts as well, which has been doubted, and paves the way for a
               more hypertextual understanding of a textual tradition. The project has worked out a
               by and large suitable layout for a digital edition of a text with a medieval
               manuscript tradition. However, future editors will need to give deeper thought to
               matters such as accurately encoding and presenting an apparatus criticus and
               improving the user friendliness of the interface. Further, because of inaccuracies in
               the digital apparatus users will want to exploit confessio.ie’s rich resources not
               instead of, but only next to Bieler’s print edition.</p>

            <head>Introduction</head>
            <p xml:id="p1">Patrick of Ireland, who in the fifth century evangelized the Irish, in
               modern-day popular culture arguably counts among the most well-known, certainly among
               the most influential Christian saints. About his life and deeds legends circulate,
               many of which find their origin in a seventh-century Life of Patrick written by the
               Irish monk, Muirchú. Two Latin texts have come down to us from Late Antiquity that
               can undoubtedly be attributed to Patrick himself: the so-called
                  <emph>Confessio</emph> and the <emph>Epistola</emph>. Both of them are written in
               epistolary form and are united in the tradition as the first and second books,
               respectively, of the <emph>Libri Epistolarum Sancti Patricii Episcopi</emph>. These
               letters have been edited in one of the few editions of ancient texts that come close
               to being definitive, by Ludwig Bieler (Bieler 1950; Bieler 1951).<note xml:id="ftn1">Collectively and under the same title, this work has been re-issued by the Irish
                  Manuscripts Commission (Dublin 1952) and – together with Bieler 1966 –
                  re-published by the Royal Irish Academy (Bieler 1993).</note>
            </p>
            <p xml:id="p2">The project under review here, called ‘Saint Patrick’s
                  <emph>Confessio</emph> Hypertext Stack Project’ (in short: confessio.ie, or
               ‘HyperStack’), aims at enabling everyone, not least those not to form part of the
               scholarly community, to “read what St Patrick actually wrote <emph>in his own
                  words</emph>” (italics original). It is Bieler’s edition which is at its core.
               Both Bieler’s work and confessio.ie are related to the same larger project, the
               Dictionary of Medieval Latin from Celtic Sources (DMLCS)<note xml:id="ftn2">Cf. the
                  website of the DMLCS, <ref target="https://web.archive.org/save/http://journals.eecs.qub.ac.uk/DMLCS/">https://web.archive.org/save/http://journals.eecs.qub.ac.uk/DMLCS/</ref>.
                  Besides numerous spin-offs and ancillary papers, the first volume of the
                  dictionary has been published, in form of an index (Harvey and Power 2005).</note>
               of the Royal Irish Academy: Bieler’s reprint of 1993 has been published as Ancillary
               Publications IV of the DMLCS.</p>
            <p xml:id="p3">Confessio.ie came into being as an initiative by the DMLCS and its
               editor, Anthony Harvey, who acted as the principal investigator. Most of the work has
               been carried out by the post-doctoral researcher, Franz Fischer, between 2008 and
               2011. They have been supported by a number of short- to mid-term-interns. For the
               technical realization, the project relied on the Digital Humanities Observatory of
               the Royal Irish Academy.<note xml:id="ftn3">
                  <ref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20191104161426/https://www.ria.ie/research-projects/archive/digital-humanities-observatory">https://web.archive.org/web/20191104161426/https://www.ria.ie/research-projects/archive/digital-humanities-observatory</ref>.</note>
               The Royal Irish Academy has funded the project and is now responsible for its
               curation and long-term sustainment. As the ongoing DMLCS project has been put in
               charge of that, the long-term availability of confessio.ie is reasonably safe.
               However, there is no guidance how to cite the digital edition.</p>
            <p xml:id="p4">Confessio.ie was launched already in September 2011.<note xml:id="ftn4">Only one review, to my knowledge, has been published (Ó Dochartaigh 2012); a more
                  user centered approach is taken by Caria and Mathiak 2018.</note> There are a
               number of reasons why it still appears worthwhile to review this resource after
               almost a decade has passed. First, confessio.ie is to date the most comprehensive
               venture to produce a digital critical edition within classical philology, and one of
               only a handful of by and large successful editions in this field.<note xml:id="ftn5">One may think of, e.g., Daniel Kiss’ Catullus Online, which however rightfully
                  presents itself as a repertory rather than an edition (<ref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20200818110425/http://www.catullusonline.org/CatullusOnline/index.php">https://web.archive.org/web/20200818110425/http://www.catullusonline.org/CatullusOnline/index.php</ref>),
                  or the test edition of Galen in the Corpus Medicorum Graecorum project (<ref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20191114230638/http://pom.bbaw.de/cmg/">https://web.archive.org/web/20191114230638/http://pom.bbaw.de/cmg/</ref>). The
                  numerous projects within, e.g., digital epigraphy or papyrology, do not bear on
                  this matter because they edit documents rather than texts transmitted in, at least
                  potentially, more than one document. The same holds for scholia, which are
                  extremely hard to transfer into a print edition (cf., e.g., Mastronarde 2010ff. or
                  the Munich based project to edit glosses on Persius and Martianus Capella <ref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20191021140937/https://www.mueze.uni-muenchen.de/editing_glosses/index.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20191021140937/https://www.mueze.uni-muenchen.de/editing_glosses/index.html</ref>).
                  Useful tools for finding (one’s way through) digital editions not only of
                  classical texts are two on line catalogues (Sahle 2008ff.; Franzini 2012ff.), and,
                  with a scope far more narrow, that is encompassing only editions that are both
                  critical and of Greek or Latin texts, <ref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20191021080038/https://wiki.digitalclassicist.org/Digital_Critical_Editions_of_Texts_in_Greek_and_Latin">https://web.archive.org/web/20191021080038/https://wiki.digitalclassicist.org/Digital_Critical_Editions_of_Texts_in_Greek_and_Latin</ref>.</note>
               Confessio.ie may thus be approached as a model by anyone who considers producing a
               digital scholarly edition of a classical text. Second, it stands out among digital
               scholarly editions due to its outreach focus. Third, within Classics and apart from
               discussions of digital editions as such (e.g., Monella 2018, 143), confessio.ie still
               tends to be largely neglected as a critical edition.</p>

            <head>Aims</head>
            <p xml:id="p5">The ‘HyperStack’ aims to serve both the scholarly community and the wider
               public. For the former, it strives to be a prime digital tool for textual research on
               Patrick. For the latter, it aims to disseminate information about the historical
               Patrick as he emerges from his writings. This two-fold objective led the project to
               assemble a vast number of different, if mostly textual documents that bear on Patrick
               and his writings.</p>
            <p xml:id="p6">Confessio.ie centers around a ‘hypertextual’ approach to its text(s)
               (Lavagnino 1997). This means, the text is not just regarded as one Latin text
               transmitted in different forms, but as a multi-layered entity consisting of many
               other things besides it (which still forms the core): Manuscripts, translations,
               earlier and recent editions and the like all form part of the same hypertext (van
               Zundert 2016, 103). Confessio.ie has been set up with this uniquely digital approach
               in mind (Fischer 2013, 82–84).</p>
            <p xml:id="p7">In terms of academic outreach, the prime goal of the project is “to give
               Irish society as direct access as possible to the historical Patrick”.<note xml:id="ftn6">
                  <ref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20191024172507/https://www.confessio.ie/about/hyperstack#">https://web.archive.org/web/20191024172507/https://www.confessio.ie/about/hyperstack#</ref>.</note>
               Apart from providing translations into various languages, the project group therefore
               have intended to provide the reader with much supporting material. Articles und other
               texts on the website address issues such as the context in which Patrick wrote<note xml:id="ftn7">

               and, perhaps even more importantly, where the widespread legends about the Irish
               patron come from (see below on supplements).</p>
            <p xml:id="p8">When it comes to confessio.ie as a research tool, the project aims on the
               one hand to make the information contained in Bieler’s editions digitally
                  available.<note xml:id="ftn8">Using the most up-to-date, most reliable edition in
                  digital and digitization projects is, contrary to what one might reasonably
                  expect, rather the exception than the rule, cf. e.g. the Library of Latin Texts
                     (<ref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20190215000000*/https://about.brepolis.net/library-of-latin-texts/">https://web.archive.org/web/20190215000000*/https://about.brepolis.net/library-of-latin-texts/</ref>),

               On the other hand, it enables researchers to directly access images of all eight
               extant manuscripts and a number of relevant publications. Confessio.ie wants to be
               the one place where all the important (textual) information on Patrick’s works is
               collected. But the project has yet another, farther reaching aim, as it aims to be a
               “case study of how to deal with text transmission and how to deal with the academic
               heritage of the print era”.<note xml:id="ftn9">

               website is well structured and particularly strong in guiding the visitor straight to
               the textual version she needs. The focus of the home page’s presentation is the text
               of Patrick’s <emph>Confessio</emph>: There, the user immediately encounters the
               text’s first paragraph in an English translation and is at the same time invited to
               read on in a language of her choice (<ref type="crossref" target="#img1">see fig.
                  1</ref>). By this means, confessio.ie strongly signals that the <emph>text</emph>
               of Patrick’s work is the centerpiece of the project.</p>
            <p xml:id="p10">If the user does not follow the suggestion to immediately read on, she
               can approach the self-explaining, well laid out top menu. This will lead her to

                     <emph>Confessio</emph>, somewhat less so of his <emph>Epistola</emph> (I will
                  come to this point). The digital edition, as indicated above, is principally a
                  digitization of Bieler’s edition and commentary from 1950/51.<note xml:id="ftn11">Bieler’s text (only) had already at an earlier point been included into the
                     Archive of Celtic-Latin Literature (ACLL) published by Brepols on behalf of
                     DMCLS. I have not been able to access ACLL.</note> In the download section
                  users can access a PDF of this edition (Bieler 1993), which is helpful for those
                  who want to compare the digital to the printed version and to access all its
                  material that does not feature on confessio.ie, such as indices or an

                  scholarly edition (TEI Consortium 2019). The project team adhere to the principles
                  laid out therein and have written their files in XML. Most philologists and
                  historians, however, are likely to be more interested in the user interface of
                  this digital edition. The main question they will ask is: Does confessio.ie
                  address what a scholar (reasonably or not) expects from an edition of a classical
                  text?</p>

                     (<ref type="crossref" target="#img2">see fig. 2</ref>). The main text,
                  including the critical sigla known from printed editions<note xml:id="ftn12">Against the custom, but as quite common on the web and elsewhere these days,
                     for additions confessio.ie does not use pointed brackets ⟨ ⟩, but
                     greater/less-than-signs &lt; &gt;.</note> and bible quotations in italics, is
                  on the center-right. The <emph>Confessio</emph> is split into the 62 paragraphs of
                  Bieler’s edition, each of which is presented on a separate page. The resulting
                  text length per page is easily digestible. Most paragraphs are, on today’s
                  ordinary desktop screens, easily presented in whole. Above the text, one finds the
                  title of the respective work (‘I. CONFESSIO’), the number of the paragraph, and a
                  search function. The search is explained in the FAQ (see below); it will search
                  the main text and each of the apparatuses/commentaries. Nothing more advanced than
                  the search for strings is supported.</p>
               <p xml:id="p15">Additional and commendable features can be found below the text.
                  Here, users can immediately access other versions of the same text they are
                  reading in Latin: introductory sections and images of each of the manuscripts and
                  earlier editions; and the relevant passage in each of the translations available
                  on confessio.ie. Regrettably though, except for the manuscripts (only via the
                  apparatus criticus!), confessio.ie is unable to display text/edition and
                  image/translation at the same time; and manuscripts are not aligned on any level
                  below page/column (see below).</p>
               <p xml:id="p16">Although all of this is useful in its own right, scholars will find
                  the left-hand column the most important one. Here, all three apparatuses from
                  Bieler’s edition are presented: an apparatus criticus, an apparatus fontium, and
                  an apparatus biblicus (in this order, which by reasonably deviating from Bieler’s
                  order (sources, critical, bible) gives the critical apparatus the prominence it
                  deserves). Bieler’s commentary is to be found here too; technically, it has been
                  treated just like the apparatuses.</p>
               <p xml:id="p17">In the default view, none of the apparatuses is opened. As all of
                  them are displayed next to each paragraph page – whether they contain information
                  or not –, users have to open them individually (or keep them open from the start
                  when navigating through the text) in order to find out if there is any information
                  stored in the respective apparatus in the respective paragraph. Especially the
                  apparatus fontium is not present on many of Bieler’s pages and thus in the digital
                  version it is oftentimes empty. At times I find it a bit distracting to still have
                  it on display all the time.</p>

                     <head type="legend">Alignment.</head>
                  </figure> The alignment of apparatuses and text are well done. In writing the XML
                  files, each word of Patrick’s text has been automatically given a unique ID. This
                  ID is named after the page, line, and word-in-line numbers of White’s edition
                  (White 1905), which are also used by Bieler. This allows for an impressively
                  reliable, detailed alignment of text and apparatus. When hovering over an
                  apparatus entry, the corresponding text is highlighted (<ref type="crossref" target="#img3">see fig. 3</ref>). All apparatuses and the commentary are
                  highlighted in the same visual way.</p>
               <p xml:id="p19">However, when the mouse hovers over the text, the corresponding
                  sections of the apparatuses are not highlighted. It is not clear if the project
                  team have consciously decided against this (and if they have, why). I for one
                  would have preferred to have also the text direct me to the apparatuses, which
                  would facilitate work when compared to the printed book (Caria and Mathiak 2018,
                  274).</p>

                  </figure> How the critical apparatus is set up to deal with manuscripts, sigla,
                  and other abbreviations, is a great help.<note xml:id="ftn13">For most traditional
                     classicists, the opportunity to get (links to) manuscripts is probably the
                     foremost advantage when it comes to digital editions.</note> This is achieved
                  by two means. First, in the apparatuses, it is easy to identify all kinds of
                  abbreviations, including sigla of manuscripts and even sigla of groups of
                  manuscripts. All manuscript group sigla are resolved when hovering over them.
                  Abbreviations of modern literature and ancient works are hyperlinked to the
                  respective bibliography or abbreviation list entries. Second, all manuscript
                  sigla, when clicked, will load an image of the relevant page of the manuscript
                  just above the main text of the <emph>Confessio</emph> (<ref type="crossref" target="#img4">see fig. 4</ref>), and thus allow direct access to the
                  sources.</p>
               <p xml:id="p21">
                  <figure xml:id="img5">

                     <head type="legend">The apparatus criticus.</head>
                  </figure> Yet there is a major disadvantage in how the apparatuses are visualized,
                  which makes them appear to lack structure and makes them hard to follow: They fail
                  to signal where an entry starts and where it ends. For example, in
                     <emph>Confessio</emph> 52 the fourth entry in Bieler runs: ‘nihilominus:
                  nihilhominum P. nihil δ’. <ref type="crossref" target="#img5">Fig. 5</ref> shows
                  how this is visualized in the digital edition. It is not intuitively clear that
                     <emph>nihil</emph> belongs to the entry in the line above (esp. when compared
                  to the first, not indented line, which exhibits three – actually four, because
                  ‘mercedem dabam V’ belongs here, too – individual entries). Neither is it
                  intuitively understandable, why some lines (or entries) are indented and some are
                  not, or indeed where an entry starts (how to tell from the layout where, e.g., the
                  entry ‘auidisse V. audissime P.’ starts and ends?).</p>
               <p xml:id="p22">The reason for this easily avoidable shortcoming is a decision the
                  project team have made about the details of their XML files. They have transformed
                  Bieler’s apparatus into XML as follows, by using the paragraph tag
                     <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> (simplified):
                  <code>&lt;note&gt;&lt;p&gt;</code>nihilominus: nihilhominum <code>&lt;ref
                     type="witness"&gt;</code>P<code>&lt;/ref&gt;</code>.<code>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;</code>nihil
                     <code>&lt;ref type="witness"&gt;</code>Î´<note xml:id="ftn14"> I. e., δ.</note>
                  <code>&lt;/ref&gt;</code>.<code>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/note&gt;</code>. But those entries
                  which exhibit only a single variant transmitted in a single manuscript or family
                  of manuscripts lack a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag: e.g.,
                  <code>&lt;note&gt;</code>cupiebam <code>&lt;ref

                  Now, when it comes to representation on screen, this use of <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>
                  has the unfortunate consequences that the entry ‘nihilominus … nihil δ’ has a line
                  break in between and thus lacks the appearance of a continuous entry. Nor is it,
                  e.g., clear that ‘me cum’ starts a new entry which runs until ‘mecum et P’ in the
                  next line.</p>

                  </figure> In the same vein, the commentary looks crowded, although contentwise it
                  isn’t. Technically the commentary is not treated differently from any of the
                  apparatuses. Each entry is identified by a <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> tag. Each
                  commentary entry is separated by an <code>&lt;ab&gt;</code> tag (in the print
                  edition, they are not aligned to the text on any sub-paragraph level either). This
                  is only rendered by a dash (—) which is hard to make out within the text of the
                  commentary (<ref type="crossref" target="#img6">see fig. 6</ref>). This
                  visualization makes the commentary quite difficult to read, at least for my eye.
                  Other options, e.g., beginning a new paragraph or highlighting the lemma, would
                  certainly find more appreciation.</p>
               <p xml:id="p24">By and large, the digital edition of confessio.ie is a digitization
                  of Bieler’s print edition. As text editions are the foundation of all further
                  research in any philology, accuracy in informing readers about manuscript readings
                  is indispensable (Reeve 2000, 200–201). In the case of confessio.ie, one will not
                  ask for an accurate representation of the manuscript evidence, but of Bieler’s
                  edition.</p>
               <p xml:id="p25">In order to judge the reliability of the work, I have taken random
                  samples. The main text has been well proofread and is, as far as I am aware, free
                  of errors. It accurately reproduces even interpunction and italicization. This
                  claim cannot unfortunately be held for the critical apparatus. The apparatus
                  criticus is the centerpiece of a scholarly edition und its quality therefore can’t
                  be neglected (Tarrant 2016, 128–40; Fischer 2019). In my samples, I have come
                  across the following deviations from Bieler’s edition (I give Bieler’s reading
                     first):<note xml:id="ftn15">I have not regularly checked if the deviations
                     tacitly emend an error made by Bieler, but where I have, I found his readings

                     (<emph>qui loquitur … iterum</emph>). There are also some rather minor errors

                  of <emph>et</emph> in the text (the error is in the XML file:

                     <code>@target="#W.236.02.05"</code>). 17 (240,1–2) Bieler writes ‘<emph>R

                  [sic]. Despite all its merits in other fields, because of these errors and
                  inaccuracies collectively, the digital edition of confessio.ie stays short of

               <head>Editorial Principles and Transmission</head>
               <p xml:id="p29">This is one of the weakest points in the digital edition. For any
                  critical edition is reasonably expected to lay out their principles in terms of,
                  e.g., method, orthography, normalization. It is equally necessary to say a word
                  about the manuscript tradition, or at least where to find such information. In
                  spite of the extensive information given in the ‘About the HyperStack project’
                  section, there is hardly a word about any of this – and if it is, users have to
                  collect the information from different parts of the web site by themselves.</p>
               <p xml:id="p30">I will give two examples which I consider especially unfortunate. The
                  first one is the stemma. Bieler was a philologist, and like most classicists a
                  ‘Lachmannian’. This means, he went to quite some lengths in order to come up with
                  a stemma, which in his case allows him, he claims, to go back to Patrick’s
                  autograph, called Σ (Bieler 1950, 7–39). He comes up with an indirect tradition,
                  Ψ, and three manuscript families of the direct tradition: D, V, and Φ comprising
                  all remaining six witnesses. All of this is hardly remarked, let alone discussed,
                  on confessio.ie. But can a critical edition, whether digital or not, really
                  dispense with it? True, there is a short note saying “Bieler’s edition is an
                  excellent attempt to reconstruct an approximate original of the
                     <emph>Confessio</emph>, the archetype Σ” (‘About the HyperStack’, 4.1). And in
                  the ‘Special Features/Key to Symbols and Abbreviations’ section there are scans of
                  Bieler’s pedigrees, without being explained: Why there, and how is one looking for
                  the relationships of the manuscripts supposed to find them? This necessary
                  information is first too little and second too scattered. It would have sufficed,
                  though, to explicitly refer the user to Bieler’s introduction for this kind of
                  information.</p>
               <p xml:id="p31">My second example concerns the alterations the confessio.ie team has
                  made to Bieler’s edition. The text they use comes from the Archive of Celtic-Latin
                  Literature, as documented in ‘About the HyperStack’ 4.2 (<ref type="crossref" target="#ftn10">see note 10</ref>). A user will however have to recur to the
                  XML file of the Latin text (where she is not directed) in order to find out about
                  the consequences. Only there (in the header, <code>&lt;notesStmt&gt;</code>),
                  there is a detailed discussion, for example, about the use of u and v, stating:
                  Bieler uses capital V and small capital u. Confessio.ie writes all consonants as
                  v, all vowels as u. In the commentary then, the capitals are all written V. This
                  is not a significant point in itself, but it is at the least not user friendly to
                  hide this kind of information in an XML file without even directing there,
                  especially when considering that many users will probably be either not ready or
                  not able to open and read an XML file.</p>

                  from the downloads section. After an introduction containing information about the
                  location, provenance, sigla (it is missing for Rouen 1391, which should be R),
                  available images, and a copyright notice, there are useful sections of various
                  detail on each manuscript’s content, physical description, history, and a

                  convenient that manuscripts are aligned to the text on page/column level only,
                  rather than on the level of paragraphs or even words (see above). This forces them
                  to spend a lot of time on searching the respective manuscript folium for the
                  passage they want to see in the original manuscript. It is especially unfortunate,
                  as confessio.ie claims that readers “are invited to find their way through the
                  dense net of textual layers” and in this respect explicitly mentions the

                  The project team have included translations of the <emph>Confessio</emph> into
                  English (McCarthy 2011), Irish (Mac Philibín 1961), Italian (Malaspina 1985),
                  Brazilian Portuguese (dos Santos 2007), German (newly translated by project’s
                  researcher, Franz Fischer), and English (Blank) Verse (Ferguson 1877–1886). There
                  are translations of the <emph>Epistola</emph> into all of these languages but
                  German. To have translations of Patrick’s texts in many languages accessibly
                  available is obviously very useful. XML files of all the translations are
                  available for download, which allows users to transform them into a format of
                  their choice.</p>
               <p xml:id="p37">As McCarthy’s new translation has been reviewed before (Ó Dochartaigh
                  2012, 32) and the other ones have been published before, I can confine myself to
                  Fischer’s German rendering of the <emph>Confessio</emph>. This is only the second
                  translation into German; the first (and to-date only one of the
                     <emph>Epistola</emph>) being Wotke 1940. Fischer has succeeded in writing a
                  vivid, readable German translation. He is exceptionally strong at rendering the
                  colloquial, paratactic, often anacoluthic style (cf., e.g., 12, 43).
                  Misrepresentations and inaccuracies are few: e.g., 4 <emph>ut didicimus</emph> is
                  rather ‘wie wir erkannt haben’ than ‘so ward es uns gelehrt’ (to say nothing of
                  the form ‘ward’ in a 21ˢᵗ century translation), 11 <emph>(epistola) non
                     deserta</emph> is hardly rendered appropriately by ‘nicht wohlfeil

                  recent study on the usability of digital scholarly editions repeatedly signalled
                  they had experienced difficulties in navigating confessio.ie (Caria and Mathiak
                  2018).</note> first, the availability and accessibility of information. Often it
               is not easy to spot the information one looks for. For example, few will suspect to
               find Bieler’s pedigree, on which the edition is based, in the subsection ‘key to
               symbols and abbreviations’ (as pointed out above, detailed discussion on how the
               manuscripts relate to each other is altogether lacking). Second, the search function
               is too limited to be of any help. Third, images of manuscripts, older editions and
               the text of confessio.ie are not closely aligned.</p>
            <p xml:id="p41">This shortcoming is not remedied by the FAQ. There are only two
               questions: “How to use the electronic version of Bieler's Latin edition?” and “How to
               use the manuscript viewer?”. They give only the most basic information and neither of
               them addresses any details.</p>

            <p xml:id="p42">The project team, thankfully, have made it easy to follow their major
               technological paths and explained in detail which tools they used and why.<note xml:id="ftn21">
                  <ref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20191022093209/https://www.confessio.ie/about/technologies">https://web.archive.org/web/20191022093209/https://www.confessio.ie/about/technologies</ref>.</note>
               Much of this has no bearing on the digital edition as it is, but only on the
               supplementary material and can thus be neglected here. The project has used the
               fairly common content management system, Drupal, for organizing their data. The high
               resolution images of the manuscripts are run by a specifically built browser-based
               viewing application. This application, about which little information is available,
               allows for sending ‘only a subset of the enormous image files to the browser’. As a
               result, the images, despite their size, load very quickly and zooming works
               impressively smooth.</p>
            <p xml:id="p43">Perhaps more importantly, the digital edition is based on an XML file
               that follows the TEI P5 standards, for obvious reasons not in the latest version (TEI
               Consortium 2019). The XML file is easily downloadable (see above). The schema they
               use, as appears from the XML file, is the then-standard TEI one (tei_all.rng, version
                  1.7.0),<note xml:id="ftn22">Available from <ref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20191021151220/https://tei-c.org/Vault/P5/1.7.0/xml/tei/custom/schema/relaxng/tei_all.rng">https://web.archive.org/web/20191021151220/https://tei-c.org/Vault/P5/1.7.0/xml/tei/custom/schema/relaxng/tei_all.rng</ref>.</note>
               which allows for using all TEI tags.</p>
            <p xml:id="p44">Encoding the apparatus criticus is in theory and practice the most
               difficult, but arguably the most important part of a digital editor’s work. For the
               TEI P5 guidelines expect such an apparatus to be more or less a repository of
               variants (chapter 12). In classical philology, at least, the critical apparatus
               serves many more purposes which philologists reasonably expect to be adequately
               represented in a digital edition too (Damon 2016; Keeline 2017; Olson 2019). Thus,
               the set-up of the apparatus criticus has been identified as the main (and in the view
               of some, insurmountable) obstacle in applying TEI to classical texts (Damon 2016;
               Fischer 2019, 213).<note xml:id="ftn23">A different approach is taken by the Digital
                  Latin project, cf. <ref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20191022092921/https://digitallatin.github.io/guidelines/LDLT-Guidelines.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20191022092921/https://digitallatin.github.io/guidelines/LDLT-Guidelines.html</ref>.</note>
            </p>
            <p xml:id="p45">The HyperStack project has found a practical solution for coping with
               this problem. Within the apparatus they use a <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> tag for each
               apparatus entry (but no <code>&lt;app&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;lem&gt;</code>, or
                  <code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code>). Whatever Bieler wrote as his own comments in the
               apparatus, is rendered by an <code>&lt;emph&gt;</code> tag. This choice serves the
               needs of humans quite well, for example in 4 (236,10–13), simplified:
                  <code>&lt;note&gt;</code>omnia — principium
                  <code>&lt;emph&gt;</code>deest<code>&lt;/emph&gt;
                  &lt;ref&gt;</code>V<code>&lt;/ref&gt;</code>; <code>&lt;emph&gt;</code>quae
               leguntur in<code>&lt;/emph&gt; &lt;ref&gt;</code>v<code>&lt;/ref&gt;</code>,
                  <code>&lt;emph&gt;</code>coniecturae
                  debentur<code>&lt;/emph&gt;</code>.<code>&lt;/note&gt;</code> . This procedure has
               the advantage that trained humans can easily identify that V has a lacuna, which has
               been filled in v by way of conjecturing. It has the severe disadvantage that this way
               of encoding differs greatly from the actual standards set by TEI P5, which thus
               cannot be exploited in its entirety.</p>

            <head>Conclusion: Confessio.ie As A Pioneer</head>
            <p xml:id="p46">Confessio.ie is a pioneering project in the field of digital editions of
               classical texts. As such, the project must be thanked for opening paths which will
               ultimately lead to native digital, critical editions also of ancient and late ancient
                  texts.<note xml:id="ftn24">In this regard, much is to be expected from the Library
                  of Digital Latin Texts (LDLT) project, which appears to approach a state where it
                  can actually be used as a proper editing tool: <ref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20191022093057/https://digitallatin.org/library-digital-latin-texts">https://web.archive.org/web/20191022093057/https://digitallatin.org/library-digital-latin-texts</ref>.</note>
               This is all the more important as research in classical philology, too, is turning
               more and more digital. In this regard, it was a wise decision to take the
               philological information from another source (Bieler’s edition) and to focus on its
               digital implementation. The Royal Irish Academy is in charge of the long-term
               sustainment of the project; hence its long-term availability is guaranteed.</p>
            <p xml:id="p47">There are many commendable features of confessio.ie. The approach to
               think of a transmitted text as a hypertext consisting of text, manuscripts, images,
               editions, translations etc. is one of the major strengths of confessio.ie: There, <cit>
                  <quote>[t]he relations between the texts and the contextualising information is
                     described, but not expressed through the ‘hyper fabric’ of e.g. HTTP links.
                     Even so, the Confessio is rather an exception to the rule—very few of today’s
                     digital editions seem to be particularly concerned with the core ideal of
                     hypertext as an expression of linked information, of process and
                     context.</quote>
                  <bibl>van Zundert 2016, 103</bibl>
               </cit> This is something only a digital edition can do – although it will not be
               feasible to use every hypertextual layer in each and every edition (Fischer 2017,
               281). In an impressive manner, confessio.ie has collected and provided any kind of
               textual information one may ask for about Patrick’s writings.</p>
            <p xml:id="p48">Confessio.ie has also shown that using TEI is indeed an apt method for
               creating digital editions of classical texts. Hence, there is no need to look for
               something else: Classics can cope with the de facto standard, although the details of
               how to encode an apparatus still are in need of a long-term solution (I doubt this
               will be settled any time soon). Even more: They have given a very useful example of
               how an edition and a digital apparatus criticus can be visualized.</p>
            <p xml:id="p49">However, there are some points that future editors should give even more
               attention to. First and foremost, and this holds for any edition, be it digital or
               not, accuracy in representing text and manuscripts readings is indispensable. This
               demand is self-evident, but it must be stressed again. As the apparatus of Bieler’s
               edition is not always adequately represented, this is a major shortcoming of
               confessio.ie and the reason why confessio.ie cannot be used instead of, but only in
               comparison with, Bieler’s edition.</p>
            <p xml:id="p50">For a critical edition to be recognized as such, it is likewise
               necessary to include all relevant information about the textual transmission and
               editorial principles. If this edition is digital, it will be helpful for all users to
               have this information easily available on the website. As for user friendliness,
               confessio.ie provides some obstacles for their users, especially in the alignment of
               images, older editions and translations, and user guidance around the website. With
               regard to these topics, future editors will be well advised to find out for
               themselves how to do better.</p>
            <p xml:id="p51">All in all, the ‘HyperStack project’ has impressively paved a route to a
               more multi-layered understanding of a ‘classical text’. It has set a first usable
               point of departure for digital editions of classical texts, and successfully provided
               a first idea of how such texts can be transferred to the digital era.</p>
