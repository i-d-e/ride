               <emph>Papyri.info</emph>, made available by the Duke University, is a text collection
               of over 50,000 documentary papyri, i.e., Greek and Latin documents, dating back to
               the IV century BC – VIII century AD, which constitute a fundamental body of evidence
               for ancient everyday life in the classical antiquity. The collection consists of
               transcriptions encoded in EpiDoc (a subset of TEI for the representation of ancient
               documents preserved in inscriptions and in papyri), metadata, links to related
               resources, and, for some records, images and translations. It also includes a
               platform for the scholarly community to contribute to the database, whether for the
               digitisation of already published material or for the proposal of new contributions,
               with an editorial vetting process. This review aims to illustrate the content of the
               collection, discussing whether the relevant information is presented in a clear way
               to the user; to assess the usability of the interface for searching and browsing the
               papyri; and to analyse the technical aspects of the resource, especially the
               integration of different databases and the possibility of downloading and reusing the
               data, while highlighting, for all these aspects, both strengths and features that
               could be improved.</p>

                  at the XXVI International Congress of Papyrology (Geneva), with a talk by Joshua

               </figure> This resource is composed of two core elements: the <emph>Papyrological
                  Navigator</emph> (PN), a tool to browse and search the texts (on which I will
               therefore focus my review), and the <emph>Papyrological Editor</emph> (PE), which
               enables users to contribute to the collection (<ref type="crossref" target="#img1">fig. 1</ref>). The content, i.e., the text of the papyri and their metadata, is
               mostly obtained from the aggregation of pre-existing databases, but also from users'
               contribution: anyone can sign up and enter new texts and metadata, or edit those
               already existing, with a procedure that includes an editorial vetting in order to
               meet scholarly standards.<note xml:id="ftn2">This collaborative model of publishing,
                  which also includes an editorial board to ensure the quality of the texts, is
                  illustrated in Baumann 2013, 92-93; Bagnall 2010, 5-6; Sosin 2010.</note>
            </p>
            <p xml:id="p3">The collection is a general purpose one, based on the principles of
               completeness and of representativeness, within its domain of documentary papyrology.
               In fact, it has become a point of reference for documentary papyrology, as it
               aggregates three major databases of documentary papyri: the <emph>Duke Databank of
                  Documentary Papyri</emph> (DDbDP), a very large collection of texts of documentary
               papyri realised by the Duke University; the <emph>Heidelberger Gesamtverzeichnis der
                  griechischen Papyruskunden Ägyptens</emph> (HGV), created at the University of
               Heidelberg, which provides the metadata of all documentary papyri; and the University
               of Michigan <emph>Advanced Papyrological Information System</emph> (APIS), focused on
               images, as well as metadata, of papyri from the North American institutions, plus a
               few small federated collections worldwide<note xml:id="ftn3">For the physical
                  collections that have been digitised in the APIS database, see the overview of
                  this project outlined in Bagnall-Gagos 2007, in part. 66-67. Roger Bagnall and
                  Traianos Gagos, founders of APIS, soon realised the potential for digitisation to
                  bring to light almost forgotten collections; this led them to digitise not only
                  the papyri of the Michigan and other American collections, but also some
                  unpublished papyri of European institutions (Bagnall-Gagos 2007, 66-67).</note>;
               also important is the integration of an essential tool for papyrological research,
               namely its main bibliographical database, the <emph>Bibliographie
                  Papyrologique</emph> (BP). The aims of completeness and representativeness are not
               explicitly stated on the <emph>Papyri.info</emph> website. We find a mention of the
               collection content on the home page, but this presents no information on its
               extension: "The Papyrological Navigator (PN) supports searching, browsing, and
               aggregation of ancient papyrological documents and related materials".
               Notwithstanding, we can infer that completeness is a principle of the collection from
               the words of one of the founders of the DDbDP, John F. Oates (1993, 62): "We are
               aiming to construct a machine-readable data bank comprising all published Greek and
               Latin documentary papyri". Also, the contributions published by William H. Willis,
               co-founder of the DDbDP with Oates, on the plan of the entering of the texts and on
               the updates on this progress demonstrate the intention that the collection may be as
               complete as possible: firstly they digitised the papyri published in the more recent
               volumes of papyrological collections, secondly the remaining volumes "in reverse
               chronological order until all are done", thirdly "all texts published separately in
               journals", and lastly the most significant corrections gathered in the dedicated
               papyrological tool, the <emph>Berichtigungsliste</emph> (Willis 1984, 172; updates on
               the progress of the data entry are provided in Willis 1988, 1992, 1994). The
               collection currently amounts to 55,080 texts, which have been merged from the DDbDP,
               each of them provided with metadata exported from the HGV and also, as to papyri from
               American collections, from the APIS. In addition to these records with the papyrus
               texts, there are 31,936 records with metadata only, exported from the HGV and APIS;
               these records pertain to published papyri whose texts have not been digitised yet, or
               to unpublished papyri whose metadata and images have been put at disposal by the APIS
               researches to enable the scholarly community to study them.<note xml:id="ftn4">Gagos
                  1996, 19-20; Gagos 1997, 155.</note> Finally, as just mentioned, there are images
               of some papyri, exported from the APIS database, and therefore pertaining to
               fragments mostly housed in American institutions.<note xml:id="ftn5">These figures
                  are drawn from the search form on the PN home page: at the bottom, the drop-down
                  menu of the "Has Transcription" selection criterion shows the values "true
                  (55080)" and "false (31936)". As one can infer, this indicates the records
                  complete with texts and those which so far exclusively contain metadata.</note>
            </p>
            <p xml:id="p4">The collection is meant to be used in research, especially by
               papyrologists or by ancient historians who need to consult papyrological primary and
               secondary sources. Besides the fields of papyrology and ancient history, the
               collection contributes to historical linguistics, helping scholars to examine the
               features of the language of the papyri – texts that constitute an important body of
               evidence for Greek and Latin in their postclassical phases, and for their contacts
               with other languages of the Mediterranean.<note xml:id="ftn6">Cf. Evans-Obbink 2010,
                  1-3, for an overview on the significance of the papyri for the study of the
                  ancient languages. The authors also explain how the research on the language of
                  the papyri is one of the areas that mostly benefits from technological advances.
                  Through the citations of the DDbDP in this volume (found by searching for "DDbDP"
                  in the index) one can find instances of linguistic researches conducted with the
                  aid of this database, now merged into <emph>Papyri.info</emph>.</note>
               <emph>Papyri.info</emph> intends to meet scholarly standards by submitting the texts
               and the changes entered by users to an editorial vetting, and by reporting the
               emendations and the supplements (both already published and newly proposed by users)
               of the text transcriptions.</p>

               </figure> Several institutions were involved in the development of Papyri.info. The

               Baumann, Hugh Cayless and Josh Sosin belong, and the Institute for the Study of the
               Ancient World (ISAW), in particular Roger Bagnall (formerly based at the Columbia
               University) are mentioned in this resource as the producers, on the home page and on
               the "About" page (<ref type="crossref" target="#img2">fig. 2</ref> and <ref type="crossref" target="#img3">3</ref>).</p>

               </figure> As well as these, more institutions were responsible for the development of
               this resource. Their role is however acknowledged only on the page about the
                  <emph>Duke Databank of Documentary Papyri</emph> (DDbDP, <ref type="crossref" target="#img4">fig. 4</ref>); as their names do not appear on the home page, nor
               on the "About" page, they are therefore little visible.</p>
            <p xml:id="p7">The then Centre for Computing in the Humanities, now Department of
               Digital Humanities, at King’s College London, was in charge of the first round of
               conversion from Beta Code into the Unicode character encoding, and from SGML into the
               EpiDoc XML standard (Bodard, Sosin, and Viglianti 2011). The Heidelberg Institut für
               Papyrologie mapped its HGV database with the other databases of papyri aggregated
               into <emph>Papyri.info</emph>, namely the DDbDP and APIS<note xml:id="ftn7">Sosin
                  2010; <emph>Papyri.info</emph>, "The DDbDP"; <emph>Integrating Digital
                     Papyrology</emph> 3, 10-11, 18-21.</note>, and, also currently, works for
               continuing the integration of the HGV metadata of new papyri into the PN<note xml:id="ftn8">J. Cowey and C. Lanz, personal communications.</note>; also, James
               Cowey in Heidelberg is co-director of the DDbDP together with Joshua Sosin, as
               reported on the information page of the DDbDP (<ref type="crossref" target="#img4">fig. 4</ref>). All this information reported on the DDbDP page is also very
               relevant to <emph>Papyri.info</emph> as a whole, as the texts, which it contributed,
               constitute the core of the PN. Furthermore, this page contains details on the
               editorial board who approves users' contributions, and it thus concerns the current
               state of the collection as well. As King's College London and the Institut für
               Papyrologie, too, gave a contribution to <emph>Papyri.info</emph>, and the latter
               still continues to collaborate, their role should be put in more evidence, and be as
               visible as the mention of the DC3 and the ISAW. Hence, King’s College London and the
               Institut für Papyrologie, too, should occur on the home page and in the history of
               the development of <emph>Papyri.info</emph> on the "About" page (<ref type="crossref" target="#img3">fig. 3</ref>), and at least the HGV should be reported on the home

               and therefore their histories are closely connected, it would be fair to mention the
               Packard funding in the "About papyri.info" page, as well: without the initial support
               from the Packard institutions, who also gave technical assistance, many of the texts

                  three pre-existing databases (as anticipated): while the <emph>Duke Databank of
                     Documentary Papyri</emph> (DDbDP), which provided the texts of the papyri, is
                  now merged into the PN, the two other resources that have been integrated into it,
                  namely the <emph>Heidelberger Gesamtverzeichnis der griechischen Papyruskunden
                     Ägyptens</emph> (HGV) and the <emph>Advanced Papyrological Information
                     System</emph> (APIS), continue to exist independently. After the integration
                  process of the HGV and APIS, updates in the HGV (i.e., metadata of newly published
                  papyri or corrections to the metadata already existing) continue to be entered
                  into the PN. James Cowey (Institut für Papyrologie of the University of
                  Heidelberg), who is both editor of the HGV and co-director of the DDbDP, is the
                  person responsible for updating the HGV and for exporting this data into GitHub,
                  with the technical assistance of Carmen Lanz (of the Institut für Papyrologie as
                  well). They report the changes to the researchers of the Duke Collaboratory for
                  Classics Computing (Ryan Baumann, Hugh Cayless and Joshua Sosin), who are in
                  charge for the maintenance of <emph>Papyri.info</emph>, so that they can merge the
                  updates from GitHub into the <emph>Papyri.info</emph> branch. Since the data of
                  the HGV are maintained and updated in a FileMaker database, whereas
                     <emph>Papyri.info</emph> is an XML based project, the XML export possibility of
                  FileMaker is used to crosswalk the data to XML, before adding them to GitHub.<note xml:id="ftn11">I was provided with the above information on the updating of the

                  </figure> As opposed to this, updates in the APIS are unfortunately not visible in
                  the PN.<note xml:id="ftn12">Joshua Sosin, personal communication.</note> The fact
                  that the PN receives updates from the HGV implies that we obtain the same results
                  if we perform the same search on the two databases. However, more precisely, the
                  number of hits of the HGV can be slightly higher, because a text may have been
                  reported on two or three different records if its dating is uncertain or if a
                  papyrus contains more than one date (the latter happens when, after being reused,
                  a papyrus is composed by separate texts copied in different moments); in this
                  case, the PN instead records the dates, or a time span, in the "Date" field of the
                  papyrus record.<note xml:id="ftn13">James Cowey, personal communication. The
                     presence of multiple records for one text, in order to represent different
                     possibilities of dating, has also been reported in Hagedorn 1994, 227, and in
                     Bagnall 1998. For example, a search for petitions retrieves 2251 results on the
                     PN and 2285 on the HGV (it is possible to search for the content type by
                     entering a term in German, e.g. "Eingabe" for "petition", both in the HGV, in
                     the "Inhalt" field, and in the PN selecting the "Metadata" option).</note>
                  Furthermore, if the same fragment contains two or more texts written by different
                  scribes, whether with a date or not, the HGV, again, treats them as distinct items
                  and uses a record for each of them, whereas the PN presents the texts in only one
                     record.<note xml:id="ftn14">This feature has been noted by Reggiani (2017,
                     74-75).</note> An opposite treatment is instead assigned to papyri that
                  preserve two or more different texts, which are however written by the same hand
                  and published together in the same edition: the PN considers them as a single
                  item, assigning them to only one record, while the HGV stores each text in a
                  different record.<note xml:id="ftn15">James Cowey, personal communication. The

                  should then resort to the PN database rather than to the HGV, if one intends to
                  obtain exact numerical data for statistical purposes. On the other hand, users may
                  wish to resort to the HGV in some cases, as its user interface allows more
                  possibilities of search and more specific searches within the dating field (see

                  within the information about the related projects (<ref type="crossref" target="#img9">fig. 9</ref>), is however not included in the "Search

                  indicative of the advantages, but also of the risks, entailed by the integration
                  of different sources into one platform. On one hand, it is possible to create
                  links between the record of a papyrus and the bibliographical record, to allow
                  adding new bibliographical information or editing the existing records, and
                  creating stable URLs to indicate a bibliographical entry – features that are not

                     <emph>Papyrological Navigator</emph> provides a very extensive collection of
                  texts of the chosen kind, i.e., documentary papyri, along with comprehensive
                  information and aids for papyrological research. However, it would be necessary to
                  inform users in a clearer and more precise way about the characteristics of its
                  material, as noted above about the source of the "Bibliography" and the status of
                  its update, and the presence of the <emph>Checklist</emph>. But, even more
                  important, a key information that is not provided concerns the kind of papyri
                  included in the collection, as there is no clear indication that
                     <emph>Papyri.info</emph> concerns <emph>documentary papyri</emph> and not
                  literary ones. The home page contains the information "The Papyrological Navigator
                  (PN) supports searching, browsing, and aggregation of ancient papyrological
                  documents and related materials" (<ref type="crossref" target="#img11">fig.
                     11</ref>); however, the phrase "ancient papyrological documents and related
                  materials" rather than "documentary papyri" may indicate, more in general, all
                  kinds of papyri, including literary and paraliterary ones. Since the name of the
                  resource does not contain a reference to the documentary character of the
                  collection either, this essential information ought to be stated at the very
                  beginning of the home page.<note xml:id="ftn20">A user I interviewed proved not to
                     be aware of the scope of the collection, as she remarked that she cannot find,
                     on the PN, the literary papyri she needed; she had been attending a module of
                     Papyrology a few years ago, but either was not given this indication or was not
                     able to recollect it as she had then not carried out papyrological research for
                     a few years.</note>

                     medical project became one of the earliest partners to contribute
                     content".</note> the first digitised medical papyri seem therefore to have
                  remained in the PN. It would be opportune to remove these texts, which are
                  duplicates of DCLP records, and whose presence can affect the results of searches
                  in <emph>Papyri.info</emph> made for statistical purposes. At least, their
                  existence in <emph>Papyri.info</emph> should be pointed out to users, who should
                  also be suggested to search the DCLP for specific queries among those categories,

                  edition abbreviation, cannot be used to find types of content, as these cannot be
                  inferred from the publication series. It would be helpful to add, in the search

                        to abbreviated words, as indicated by the small superscript circle.

                  point out, are those of scribal mistakes and abbreviations. The ability to search
                  for mistakes is useful to check the validity of a conjecture when one suspects
                  that, in one's own editorial work with documentary texts, a damaged line
                  contained, in the gap, a misspelled word: since the original form employed by the
                  scribe is always reported in the texts in <emph>Papyri.info</emph> (as well as the
                  normalised one), the user can look up the incorrect word they have conjectured, to
                  verify whether it is a mistake commonly attested in papyri. As regards the search
                  for abbreviations, this is useful to understand how an abbreviation found in one's
                  text could be expanded; this search is possible because both the abbreviated word
                  reported by the scribe and the expanded form restored by the editor are indicated
                  in the texts in <emph>Papyri.info</emph>, and because the search form includes the
                  possibility to specifically search for abbreviations (<ref type="crossref" target="#img16">fig. 16</ref>).</p>

                     refer to Bodard 2010, 101-104, and Cayless et al. 2009, 1-2.</note> These
                  texts, inscriptions and papyri, are ancient documents of direct tradition, i.e.,
                  discovered in archaeological excavations rather than handed down to us through
                  medieval tradition. This implies the advantage of their chronological closeness to
                  the ancient historical events and literary works, but also the problem of their
                  severely damaged state of preservation. Hence the necessity to develop such a
                  system as the Leiden Convention: this allows accounting for the physical
                  appearance of the texts and for the editorial decisions taken in the restoration
                  of the missing words and in the interpretation of the signs employed by the
                  ancient scribes. Examples from the Leiden transcription style are the square
                  brackets that surround the letters lost in a lacuna and restored by the editor,
                  the dots under the line to indicate letters of uncertain reading, and round

                     2013).</note> The collection has recently started being exploited in this
                  sense, even though there are still few examples of this use, which obviously
                  requires higher technical skills. One needs to download the XML files of the
                  texts, which can be done both for single papyri and for the collection as a whole.
                  Texts can be downloaded individually by clicking on the "xml" link in the
                  transcription heading of each papyrus record. Otherwise, one can download the
                  entire collection from the GitHub data repository of <emph>Papyri.info</emph>

                  Here the XML files of the texts are contained in the "DDB_EpiDoc_XML" folder,
                  grouped in bundles according to the publication volumes; a bundle with the texts
                  provided with translations in English or German is also available from the GitHub
                  repository, by the name "HGV_trans_EpiDoc". While the decision to make this and
                  all the other data of <emph>Papyri.info</emph> publicly available ensures
                  transparency and allows a variety of scholarly reuses, the possibility to download
                  of the texts could be more flexible and more clearly indicated. Ideally, it should
                  be possible to download a bundle of selected files as well, besides those grouped
                  by their publication volume and those that include translations. Also, a link to
                  the GitHub repository should be provided, as there is currently no way to know
                  about the possibility of downloading all the texts in one bundle or the

                  from <emph>Papyri.info</emph> to build up a corpus of treebanked Greek documentary
                  papyri. After being downloaded, the texts are enriched with morpho-syntactic
                  annotation, carried out with the <emph>Arethusa</emph> tool on the
                     <emph>Perseids</emph> platform. The corpus will enable the analysis of the
                  linguistic structures of the texts on an extensive scale, and will facilitate
                  comparisons between the scribes' original text (with mistakes, peculiar spellings,
                  and non-expanded abbreviations) and the standard Greek, and between different

                  to create a corpus of morphologically annotated texts of documentary papyri;
                  however, in <emph>Sematia</emph> the linguistic annotation is carried out

                     there are no morpho-syntactic annotations in the texts in the PN, which
                     therefore cannot be queried in this way, for example to search for all the
                     infinitives. By the same token, Clarysse (2010, 44) remarks the absence of
                     syntactical annotation, which would permit to search for different kinds of
                     clauses.</note> In fact, the texts of <emph>Papyri.info</emph> have been used

                  </figure> A minor problem encountered in downloading the texts, experienced by
                  Alek Keersmaekers for his research and by myself when importing a text to
                     <emph>Arethusa</emph> to carry out the linguistic annotation for
                     <emph>Sematia</emph>, is the necessity to sometimes split up words manually, as
                  the space for the word division can be missing in the XML files of the texts. This
                  issue occurs whenever the end of a word coincides with the end of a line in the
                  papyrus text. Regarding this problem, it can be mentioned that there are currently
                  no guidelines in <emph>Papyri.info</emph> on how to enter texts with the
                     <emph>Papyrological Editor</emph>; as much as the "Text Leiden+ Documentation"
                  (the complete list of markup signs for encoding the texts)<note xml:id="ftn36">

                  is of great help, it would be convenient to add guidelines so as to provide users
                  with indications on the whole encoding procedure of a text, especially those who
                  have not attended an EpiDoc workshop or might need to recollect the procedure
                  after some time. Within these directions, it could be suggested to contributors to
                  add a space after the word endings that occur at the end of a line: this detail,
                  which entails no difference in the text publication, would however ensure a
                  correct word division in the XML files whenever they are downloaded.</p>

               </figure> The user interface is divided into two columns, which contain the search
               form, on the left-hand side, and detailed directions for its use, on the right-hand
               side (<ref type="crossref" target="#img21">fig. 21</ref>), respectively. A small
               drawback of the directions’ display is that, if we narrow the browser window even
               only slightly, they move to the bottom of the page, sometimes becoming completely
               invisible. We also cannot see the directions after performing a search, as the right
               column gets occupied by the list of the results (<ref type="crossref" target="#img22">fig. 22</ref>). Hence it would be useful to always have a link to the directions,
               in the result page, too, as one interviewed user highlighted. In fact, she could not
               recall where the directions were, as they are not available on the result page and
               she did not notice them on the PN home page, since she was focused on the left part
               of the screen to enter her data. The link to the search directions could be added to
               the grey menu bar on top of the page, after the "Bibliography" link, thereby being
               visible on every page and regardless of the width of the browser window.</p>

               selecting the respective buttons. It would be a small improvement to facilitate a new
               search on the result page of a previous query, rather than on the home page.</p>
            <p xml:id="p33">On the result page, one may expect that entering a new word and hitting
               the "Search" button will perform a new search; the result is, instead, a refined
               search. Users should, in fact, click on the x-button in the black box on top of the
               results to remove the previous search value; however, this button is not evident, as
               was also pointed out by one of the interviewed users. As an alternative, one can
               perform a new search by clicking on the "New Search" button; users, though, need to
               remember that they should first click on "New Search", and only then enter the new
               value (and finally perform their search by hitting "Search"): if one types the new
               word first, and then hits "New Search", as it may happen, this will remove the new
               value. This aspect could be improved by allowing the "New Search" button to perform a
               search with the new value, rather than to go back to the PN home page. Moreover, the
               "Search" button could be renamed "Refine Search" to explain its function more
               clearly; even though this phrase is already present, on the top left, it would be
               more evident if it was positioned on the button, where users actually need to
               click.</p>
            <p xml:id="p34">Other aspects of the PN user interface can be better illustrated by way
               of a comparison with the interface of the HGV, the Heidelberg database with records
               of metadata. As we have seen, the PN offers more accurate results than the HGV
               because it does not contain multiple records for the same papyrus, as the HGV does
               whenever a dating is uncertain. On the other hand, a reason why one may still wish to
               utilise the HGV database is that its interface offers more possibilities of search
               than that of the PN. The HGV allows searching for a date according to a single year,
               and even a month or a day; moreover, one can search for any range of time (by
               entering any year into the "ChronMinimum" and "ChronMaximum" fields). Instead, on the
               PN one can perform a search by date exclusively by selecting a predefined value in
               the "Date on or after" and/or "Date before" fields, within a fifty-year range.
               Surprisingly, if one tries searching for a single year among the PN metadata (by
               entering it in the search field and selecting the "Metadata" option), no result is
               retrieved, although the help information (in the right-hand pane of the search)
               states that this search is possible, as one in fact expects.<note xml:id="ftn37">Cf.
                  the following passage in the "More about string-search" section, about the
                  metadata search: "Metadata: Searches the metadata associated with the document -
                  for example, the identification number, location, and dating of the
                  document".</note>

                     highlighted. In whatever language the reference edition is, and therefore the
                     title of the record (here in French: "Ordre"), the keywords of the content type
                     are reported in German, among the "Subjects" ("Anordnung", etc.). They are the
                     same as the keywords reported in the HGV "Inhalt" field (<ref type="crossref" target="#img21">fig. 21</ref>).</head>

                     which are exported to the PN "Subjects" field. <ref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20171004154817/http://aquila.zaw.uni-heidelberg.de/hgv/18994">https://web.archive.org/web/20171004154817/http://aquila.zaw.uni-heidelberg.de/hgv/18994</ref>.
                  </head>
               </figure> Another frequent kind of search is the one by content type, as scholars
               need to find documents of the same type (e.g., a petition or a will), to study their
               features and to verify supplements in lacunous passages. This kind of search is
               possible in the PN, too, like in the HGV, but it is less clear to find out how this
               search works. While in the Heidelberg database there is a specific field for the
               search by kind of content, in the PN this information needs to be searched for in the
               "Search" field, ticking the "Metadata" option, as it does not have a dedicated field,
               unlike, for example, "Provenance" or "Date". In this way, the ability to do this
               search may not be evident: one of the users I interviewed was not aware of that
               possibility, even though he had interest in finding documents of a specific type on
               which his research focuses. Above all, users are not made aware that, because the
               metadata is imported from the HGV, the term referring to the content type needs to be
               entered in German (whereas in the HGV search interface this is self-evident as German
               is the language of all the information throughout the database). In fact, in every PN
               record the content type of a papyrus is indicated by a term in German, in the
               "Subjects" field of the HGV section (<ref type="crossref" target="#img25">fig.
                  25</ref>). Because this indication is not reported, one of the users I
               interviewed, to make sure to find all the documents of a specific type in whatever
               language they have been published, enters the term of her interest in several
               languages (English, German, French and Italian), which is however unnecessary.</p>
            <p xml:id="p36">It is also true that users look for types of documents not only by means
               of a metadata search, but also by searching the texts for significant words that are
               typical of certain documents; they are therefore able to find texts of a certain
               category with this other method. Two users I interviewed combine this kind of search
               with the previous one about the metadata: for example, they look up formulas or
               keywords, like "ἐξαυτῆς" ("at once"), a word typically occurring in summons, in order
               to retrieve all the texts of this category. Indeed, the HGV warns users that "there
               is no guarantee of completeness in the case of searching according to content as we
               did not develop a system of categorisation"<note xml:id="ftn38">HGV, "Search Tips and
                  other Information", <ref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20171004170724/http://aquila.zaw.uni-heidelberg.de/help/search/en">https://web.archive.org/web/20171004170724/http://aquila.zaw.uni-heidelberg.de/help/search/en</ref>.</note>;
               it would be useful to point out this limitation in the PN search form, as well, in
               the help information in the right-hand part of the search page (among the information
               about "Metadata", in the "More about string-search"), so as to suggest users to use
               both search methods.</p>
            <p xml:id="p37">In conclusion, there are a few circumscribed problems that slightly
               limit the usability of the search interface, especially for first users, sometimes
               causing them to spend more time than necessary when performing a new search, looking
               for typologies of documents, and seeking for texts within a limited time-span.</p>

            <head>Conclusion</head>
            <p xml:id="p38">The process of integration of the three main databases, accomplished in
               the <emph>Integrating Digital Papyrology</emph> project, has allowed the integration
               of different kinds of data, in different formats: the texts, coming from the
                  <emph>Duke Databank</emph> and encoded in Beta Code and SGML, were converted into
               Unicode and EpiDoc TEI; they were integrated with the metadata and the images, on
               records encoded in FileMaker and exported to XML, from the Heidelberg HGV and the
               Michigan APIS databases. The merging of texts and metadata was facilitated by the
               addition, to the texts, of a unique identifier, i.e., the <emph>Trismegistos</emph>
               number. A great effort was put into this process, in the <emph>Integrating Digital
                  Papyrology</emph> project which consisted in three phases and lasted six years,
               from 2007 to 2012 (Sosin 2010, Baumann et al. 2011). Papyrologists can thus now
               access their main resources from only one extensive platform. The conversion to
               EpiDoc, an open markup standard which is a subset of TEI, ensures that
                  <emph>Papyri.info</emph> has a high degree of compatibility with other projects in
               the Humanities and a long-term sustainability.</p>
            <p xml:id="p39">To summarise the strengths and weaknesses of <emph>Papyri.info</emph>,
               we might highlight that the comprehensiveness of the material, the integration of the
               different databases (both of texts and metadata, and of research tools) and the
               ability of an integrated search across them explain why this is an indispensable
               resource for the study of documentary papyri. However, precisely to valorise the
               collection, that is, to enable users to take advantage of all its features, there
               should be a better communication about the characteristics of its content and tools,
               and about the procedure to contribute new data. Other useful additions would be
               pointing to resources where similar content can be found, as happens for the literary
               and medical papyri on the <emph>Digital Corpus of Literary Papyri</emph>, and more
               accuracy in the documentation relative to the involved institutions and staff.</p>
